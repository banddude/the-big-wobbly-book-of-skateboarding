THE

**BIG WOBBLY BOOK**

OF

**SKATEBOARDING**

*A Real, Actual, Legitimate Guide*

*(With Only Moderate Amounts of Silliness)*

For Kids, Parents, and Anyone Else

Who Has Ever Looked at a Skateboard and Thought:

***\\"How hard can it be?\\"***

*(Very. The answer is very.)*

*(Imagine a hippo on a halfpipe right here.)*

*[Baby Skate Bunny riding confidently, arms out, little smile. The forest critters — Squirrel, Kitty, Turtle, Duck, and Jay — trailing behind in a wobbly line on their own boards. Cream background, pink clouds. This is the cover energy.]*

**A NOTE BEFORE WE BEGIN**

*(Please actually read this part.)*

This is a real book about skateboarding.

A real, actual, genuinely useful book. It will teach you real things about a real sport that real people do on real concrete with real consequences.

It just happens to be written by someone who believes that learning does not have to be boring, and that humor and safety gear can coexist peacefully.

This book is for kids **AND** for the grown-ups who love them. Parents, guardians, cool aunts, nervous grandparents—you are all welcome here. In fact, you are *encouraged* here. Skateboarding is more fun when someone is watching and cheering (or at least standing nearby with a first aid kit and a concerned expression).

Everything in this book—the safety information, the technique instructions, the practice progression—is based on real skateboarding instruction. I've just made it more fun to read.

Because here's the thing about skateboarding: it's going to be hard. You're going to fall. You're going to want to quit. And the difference between the people who become skateboarders and the people who don't is not talent.

*It's stubbornness.*

And maybe this book.

Let's begin.

**CHAPTER 1**

*THE SKATEBOARD: AN INTRODUCTION TO YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND / NEMESIS*

A skateboard is a deceptively simple object.

It is a piece of wood with four wheels. That's it. That's the whole thing. A toddler could describe it. And yet this simple piece of wood with four wheels has been making humans fall down in spectacular fashion since the 1950s.

Let's get to know the parts.

*[Baby Skate Bunny holding a skateboard up vertically like a show-and-tell presentation, pointing at it with one paw. Squirrel next to her with a tiny pointer stick, looking scholarly. Labeled diagram style — arrows pointing to deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, nose, tail — but drawn in the Baby Skate Bunny style with thick outlines and soft colors.]*

> A note for parents: A complete beginner skateboard from a real skate shop (not a toy store) will run about $80–$140. The toy store boards with the cartoon characters on them look cute but they roll like shopping carts with broken wheels. Invest in a real one. Your child's ankles will thank you.

**THE DECK** is the flat wooden part you stand on. It is made of layers of maple wood pressed together, which is called "ply." Most decks are 7-ply. It is strong. It has to be. It is going to hold you, your hopes, and your dreams. (And occasionally your backside, after you fall on it.)

**THE GRIP TAPE** is the sandpapery stuff on top of the deck. It keeps your feet from sliding off. It will also destroy your shoes. This is normal. This is expected. Shoe companies are aware of this. It is a whole economy.

**THE TRUCKS** are the metal T-shaped things on the bottom. They connect the wheels to the deck and they let you turn. Loose trucks = easier turning, more wobble. Tight trucks = harder turning, more stability. Beginners: keep them a little tighter. You have enough to worry about.

**THE WHEELS** are round. (Thank goodness.) They come in different sizes and hardnesses. Bigger, softer wheels = smoother ride over rough ground. Smaller, harder wheels = better for tricks. For learning, go bigger and softer. The sidewalk is bumpy enough already.

**THE BEARINGS** are inside the wheels and make them spin. You don't need to know much about them right now except: keep them dry. Water is the enemy of bearings. Water is the enemy of skateboarding in general. Rain is skateboarding's villain origin story.

**THE NOSE** is the front of the board. **THE TAIL** is the back. The nose is usually a little wider and the tail is a little steeper. How do you tell them apart? Look at the graphic on the bottom. The top of the picture faces the nose. If there's no graphic, look for the slightly wider, slightly less steep end—that's the nose.

*[Turtle sniffing the nose of a skateboard. Literally. Because it's called the nose. Turtle looks curious and slightly confused.]*

**CHAPTER 2**

*SAFETY GEAR: THE STUFF BETWEEN YOU AND THE CONCRETE*

I know.

*I know.*

You want to skip this chapter.

I can feel it. You're looking at your board. You're looking at this chapter about gear. You're thinking: "Can I just go ride?"

Not yet. A few more pages. I promise they're important.

Here's the thing about safety gear: the people who are the actual best at skateboarding wear it. Professional skateboarders—the ones who do the incredible things you see in videos, the ones who make it look easy, the ones who are definitely, undeniably, objectively cool—they wear helmets. They wear pads. Tony Hawk wears a helmet. Andy Anderson wears a helmet. The people who are the best at this sport protect their heads.

Because your brain is you. Your brain is every trick you'll ever learn, every joke you'll ever laugh at, every friend you'll ever make. It deserves a helmet.

**Here's what IS cool: being able to skateboard again tomorrow because you were smart today.**

*[Baby Skate Bunny in full gear — helmet, knee pads, wrist guards — standing proudly with paws on hips. The critters lined up getting geared up too. Duck trying to figure out how to put on wrist guards with wings, looking baffled. Squirrel adjusting a helmet that's slightly too big.]*

**THE GEAR LIST**

**HELMET (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

Get a skateboard helmet certified to the ASTM F1492 standard—this is the skateboarding-specific safety standard, and it means the helmet is built to handle multiple impacts (unlike bike helmets, which are designed for a single big hit). Look for that certification on the sticker inside the helmet. Even better: find one that's dual-certified to both ASTM F1492 and CPSC. It should sit low on your forehead, about two finger-widths above your eyebrows. It should be snug. It should not wobble. If you shake your head vigorously and it moves, it's too big. (If you shake your head vigorously and it doesn't move but you get dizzy, you may have shaken too vigorously.)

Replace your helmet after any significant impact, even if it looks fine. The foam inside is designed to crush on impact—once it's crushed, it won't protect you again. A helmet is a one-hit wonder.

**WRIST GUARDS (EXTREMELY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)**

When you fall—and you will fall, this is not a threat, it is a physics-based prediction—your instinct will be to catch yourself with your hands. This is a terrible instinct, but it is a very powerful one. Wrist guards have a rigid splint that distributes the impact across your whole forearm instead of concentrating it on your wrist bones. Wrist fractures are the most common skateboarding injury. Wrist guards are cheap. Do the math.

label: "Ch 2 — Safety Gear (knees + shoes)"
page: 8
---

**KNEE PADS (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)**

Good knee pads aren't just protection—they're actually a falling tool. We're going to learn to fall on our knee pads on purpose. This is called a "knee slide," and it's one of the most important skills in skateboarding. Hard-shell knee pads (the kind with the plastic cap) let you slide when you fall instead of sticking and tumbling. This is a feature, not a bug.

**ELBOW PADS (RECOMMENDED)**

Like knee pads but for your elbows. Your elbows are pointy and full of nerve endings and they would like to be protected, please.

**SKATE SHOES (IMPORTANT)**<p>Flat-soled shoes. Not running shoes (too curved). Not sandals (no). Not boots (too heavy). Flat, grippy soles that can feel the board under your feet. Vans, Etnies, Nike SB—there are lots of options. The grip tape will eat them eventually. This is the cost of doing business.

> A note for parents: Please, please, please do not make safety gear a negotiation. It's not optional at any age. And the best way to make your kid wear gear without a fight? Wear some yourself if you're out there too. Model it. Make it normal. Make it boring. Boring is the goal.

**CHAPTER 3**

*BEFORE YOU ROLL: THE STUFF NOBODY WANTS TO DO BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD*

I know you want to get on the board right now.

I know. I see you eyeing it. It's right there. It has wheels. It's calling to you.

But we're going to spend a few minutes not riding it first, and I promise this will make everything better when you do.

**FINDING YOUR STANCE**

*[Two panels side by side: Baby Skate Bunny in "regular" stance (left foot forward), Squirrel in "goofy" stance (right foot forward). Both looking perfectly content. A little label under each: "Regular" and "Goofy." Neither is wrong.]*You need to figure out which foot goes in front.</p>

**Regular** means your left foot is forward. **Goofy** means your right foot is forward. Neither one is better or worse. "Goofy" is not an insult. (Well, it might be in other contexts, but not here.)

Here are three ways to figure out your stance:

**THE SLIDE TEST:** Put on socks. Stand on a smooth floor. Run and slide. Whichever foot you naturally put forward? That's your front foot.

**THE PUSH TEST:** Have someone gently push you from behind. Whichever foot you step forward with to catch yourself? Front foot.

**THE STAIR TEST:** Which foot do you naturally step up with first when you climb stairs? That's probably your front foot.

If all three tests give you different answers, go with whatever feels most comfortable. There is no wrong answer here. (This is one of very few contexts in which I will say that.)

page: 11
---

**GETTING TO KNOW YOUR BOARD (WITHOUT MOVING)**

Find a patch of grass or carpet. Set your board on it. The soft surface will keep it from rolling while you practice.

**STEP 1: Just Stand On It.**

Put your front foot near the front bolts (the screws you can see on top near the nose). Put your back foot near the back bolts. Stand there. Breathe. Notice that you are standing on a board and you are fine. This is good.

**STEP 2: Bend Your Knees.**

A low center of gravity is your best friend in skateboarding. (Gravity is simultaneously your best friend and your worst enemy in skateboarding. It's complicated.) Bend your knees. Keep your shoulders over your feet. Imagine you are a very relaxed, slightly crouching person who is totally in control. Because you are.

*[Kitty standing on a board on the grass, knees slightly bent, looking nervous but trying. Baby Skate Bunny nearby giving a little thumbs-up. A small heart above Bunny's head.]*

---

**STEP 3: Shift Your Weight.**

Lean a little toward your toes. Lean a little toward your heels. Feel how the board tips? On concrete, this is what makes you turn. Right now, on the grass, it's just getting your body used to the feeling.

**STEP 4: Practice Getting On and Off.**

Step on. Step off. Step on again. Get comfortable with the motion. Know where your feet go without looking. This is going to become automatic, but right now you're building the muscle memory.<p>Spend at least 10 minutes doing this. I know it doesn't feel like "real" skateboarding. But you know what else doesn't feel like real skateboarding? Falling off in the first three seconds because you weren't comfortable on the board.

> A note for parents: This is a great time to just be present and encouraging. "You look solid up there" is a good thing to say. "Let me get a video!" is also a good thing to say. "Why aren't you moving yet?" is not.

**CHAPTER 4**

*HOW TO FALL (THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK)*

Read that subtitle again.

**This is the most important chapter in this book.**

Not how to ollie. Not how to kickflip. How to fall. Because you are going to fall hundreds of times before you land your first trick, and the skateboarders who last are the ones who learned to fall well.

Falling well is a skill. It can be learned. And you're going to practice it right now, on purpose.

**THE GOLDEN RULES OF FALLING**

**RULE 1: NEVER CATCH YOURSELF WITH STRAIGHT ARMS.**

This is how wrists break. Straight arms + impact = all the force going into two tiny wrist joints. Instead, bend your arms and try to roll with the fall. (If you're wearing wrist guards, they help a lot, but don't rely on them alone.)

**RULE 2: TUCK AND ROLL.**

When you feel yourself falling, bend everything—knees, elbows, neck (tuck your chin!). Get small. Round. Like a ball. Balls bounce; sticks snap. Be a ball, not a stick.

*[Baby Skate Bunny demonstrating a tuck-and-roll on grass. Big motion lines. Critters watching with tiny notebooks and serious expressions, like they're studying. Turtle looks especially confident about the "be a ball" part — naturally round.]*

label: "Ch 4 — How to Fall (rules 3-4)"
page: 14
---

**RULE 3: SPREAD THE IMPACT.**

The goal is to land on the big, padded, fleshy parts of your body (thighs, butt, shoulders) rather than the small, bony, breakable parts (wrists, elbows, tailbone). If you can turn a fall into a roll or a slide, the impact gets spread across a larger area and a longer time. Physics! It's useful!

**RULE 4: THE KNEE SLIDE (YOUR SECRET WEAPON).**

If you're wearing hard-shell knee pads (and you are, because you read Chapter 2), you can drop to your knees and slide. This is how bowl and ramp skaters bail out of tricks. It looks dramatic and it works. Here's how to practice:

*[Baby Skate Bunny doing a dramatic knee slide on a smooth surface. Dust clouds behind her. Knee pads gleaming. Jay watching from the side with wide eyes, impressed. Speed lines.]*On a smooth surface (a garage, a basketball court, a kitchen floor if your parents are out and the floor is clean), put on your knee pads. Walk forward. Drop to your knees and slide. That's it. Practice it until it feels natural. The goal is to make this your default bail-out move when things go wrong.</p>

    "14-ch-4-how-to-fall-rule-5-practice.md": `---
label: "Ch 4 — How to Fall (rule 5 + practice)"
page: 15
---

**RULE 5: KNOW WHEN TO RUN IT OUT.**

Sometimes, especially at low speeds, you can just\\... step off. The board goes one way, you run forward a few steps, everybody's fine. This is a completely legitimate strategy. There is no shame in stepping off. You are not giving up. You are making a tactical decision.

**FALLING PRACTICE (YES, REALLY)**

Get on the grass again. Put on all your gear. Now:

**1. Practice squatting low and falling to the side.** Roll onto your hip and shoulder. Do this ten times. Get used to how it feels.

**2. Practice the tuck and roll.** From a squat, fall forward and roll over your shoulder. (Like a somersault, but starting from the side.) Five times each direction.

**3. Practice the knee slide.** On a smooth surface, walk and drop. Ten times.

**4. Practice running off the board.** On the grass, stand on your board, then step forward and jog a few steps. Ten times.<p>This is going to feel ridiculous. You are a person deliberately falling down on a lawn. But every professional skateboarder has done this. Every single one. The ones who didn't practice falling are the ones who stopped skating because they got hurt.

> A note for parents: Falling practice is one of the most valuable things you can do with your kid. Do it with them. Fall down on the grass together. Laugh about it. Make it fun. If they see you doing it, it's not embarrassing—it's just what you do.

**CHAPTER 5**

*YOUR FIRST RIDE, OR: OH NO, IT'S MOVING*

Okay. You've practiced standing. You've practiced falling. You know the parts of your board. You are wearing your gear. It is time.

Find a smooth, flat surface. A tennis court, an empty parking lot, a wide sidewalk with no cracks. Avoid hills. Avoid busy areas. Avoid anywhere a car might appear. (Cars always win in a fight with skateboards. Always.)

**PUSHING**

*[Baby Skate Bunny pushing off, one foot on the board, one foot on the ground. Wind lines behind her ears. Squirrel rolling alongside looking thrilled, mouth open. Cream background.]*Your front foot goes on the board, angled forward, toes pointing roughly toward the nose. (Later, you'll rotate it sideways. For now, forward.)</p>

Your back foot pushes off the ground, like you're riding a scooter. Short, gentle pushes. You don't need speed. You need control.

After you push, put your back foot on the tail, rotate your front foot sideways, and ride. Knees bent. Weight centered. Breathe.

***Common Mistake #1:*** Pushing with your front foot. Some people do this (it's called "mongo pushing") and while it works, it makes everything else harder later. Push with your back foot.

***Common Mistake #2:*** Standing too stiff. Your knees need to be your shock absorbers. Stiff legs mean every crack and pebble goes straight to your brain.

***Common Mistake #3:*** Looking at your feet. Look where you're going. Your feet will figure it out.

**STOPPING**

There are three beginner-friendly ways to stop. Learn all of them.

*[Three small spot illustrations in a row: Duck doing a foot brake (dragging foot, concentrating hard). Kitty doing a step-off (walking casually away from a rolling board, tail up). Turtle doing a tail scrape (determined expression, sparks flying from the tail). Labels under each.]*

**THE FOOT BRAKE:** Take your back foot off the board and gently drag the sole of your shoe on the ground. Don't stomp. Drag. Like you're trying to flatten a very persistent bug. This is the most common beginner stop.

**THE STEP-OFF:** At low speeds, just step off the front of the board and walk. Let the board roll behind you (or step on the tail to stop it). Simple. Undramatic. Effective.

**THE TAIL SCRAPE:** Shift your weight to the back foot and press down on the tail so it drags on the ground. This wears down your tail over time, so use the foot brake more often, but it's good to know.

Practice stopping before you practice going fast. This seems obvious but I promise you at least half the people reading this were about to skip this part.

**TURNING**

*[Baby Skate Bunny carving a big lazy S-turn, looking relaxed and happy. Dotted line behind showing the S-path. A couple of orange cones in the background.]*Remember how we leaned on the grass? Same thing, but now you're rolling.</p>

Lean your toes and the board curves one way. Lean your heels and it curves the other. These are called **carving turns** and they are how you steer.

Start with big, wide, lazy turns. You are not slalom skiing. You are gently suggesting to the board that maybe, perhaps, if it's not too much trouble, it might go a little bit to the left.<p>As you get more comfortable, your turns will get sharper. But for now: gentle.

> A note for parents: Your job during first rides is to be a calm presence. Stand nearby. Resist the urge to hover or grab them. If they fall, wait a beat—let them decide if they need help. Say "nice!" a lot. Mean it.

**CHAPTER 6**

*THE PRACTICE PLAN: WHAT TO DO AND WHEN TO DO IT*

Here's the thing nobody tells you: skateboarding is not a sport you get good at quickly. It's a sport you get good at consistently.

Fifteen minutes a day beats two hours once a week. Your body needs repetition. Your brain needs repetition. Your courage needs repetition.

Here is a practice plan. Follow it, adjust it, make it yours. But follow something.

*[Baby Skate Bunny holding a little clipboard with checkmarks on it. In the background, critters practicing different things — Squirrel pushing, Duck turning, Kitty just standing on a board looking proud of herself, Turtle slowly rolling.]*

**WEEK 1--2: THE BASICS**

**Every session should include:**

- • 5 minutes of falling practice (even on days you don't feel like it)

- • Pushing and riding in a straight line

- • Stopping (foot brake, step-off)

- • Gentle turns in both directions**Your goals:**</p>

- • Push and ride 50 feet without stepping off

- • Stop on purpose within a few feet of where you intend

- • Make S-turns without feeling like you're about to die

**WEEK 3--4: BUILDING CONFIDENCE**

**Add to your sessions:**

- • Riding over small cracks and bumps (weight forward, knees bent)

- • Faster pushes and longer rides

- • Tighter turns

- • Riding in a circle, both directions**Your goals:**</p>

- • Ride comfortably at a jogging pace

- • Turn sharply enough to avoid an obstacle

- • Feel relaxed on the board (you'll know because your shoulders drop)**WEEK 5--8: READY FOR MORE**</p>

**Now you can start exploring:**

- • Riding up and down gentle slopes (GENTLE. I said GENTLE.)

- • Kickturns (lifting the front wheels and pivoting on the back wheels)

- • Riding switch (with your other foot forward—this will feel like
starting over, and that's okay)</p>

- • Manuals (balancing on just the back wheels while rolling—start with
one second, then two)</p>

- • Tic-tacs (quick left-right kickturns to build speed without pushing)

**WEEK 9+: THE TRICK DOOR**

If you've done all the above, you are ready to start learning your first real trick: **the ollie.**

The ollie is skateboarding's foundational trick. It's how you jump with the board. Its inventor, Alan "Ollie" Gelfand, actually stumbled onto it by accident in the late 1970s while skating a poorly built pool in Florida—and it took the skateboarding world years to fully understand and adapt it. Rodney Mullen later figured out how to do it on flat ground. Learning to ollie will take you weeks of practice. This is normal.

*[Baby Skate Bunny mid-ollie, board in the air under her feet, ears flying up, looking surprised and delighted. The critters below looking up with star-eyes and open mouths. This is the aspirational image.]*But that's another chapter for another day. (Or another book. One that will definitely contain diagrams and probably more jokes about gravity.)

> A note for parents: Progress is not linear. Some days they'll look amazing. Some days they'll look like they've never seen a skateboard before. Both are normal. Both are part of the process. Keep showing up.

**CHAPTER 7**

*THE HARD PARTS (AND THEY ARE VERY HARD)*

Now we need to talk about the difficult stuff.

Not the physical stuff—we've covered falling and pushing and stopping. The hard part of skateboarding is not the skateboarding.

**The hard part is the feeling.**

**WHEN YOU FALL AND IT HURTS**

You will have a bad fall. Not a cute fall. Not a funny fall. A fall where you hit the ground and it hurts and maybe you cry and maybe you feel scared and maybe you don't want to get back on the board.

This is normal.

This is so normal that every skateboarder has a story about it. Ask any skater about their worst fall and watch their eyes light up as they tell you. Because on the other side of that fall, they got back on.

But here's the important thing: **you don't have to get back on immediately.**

Sit down. Breathe. Check yourself over. Make sure nothing is actually injured (not just hurt—there's a difference, and we'll cover it below). Drink some water. Sit for five minutes or twenty minutes or the rest of the day.

Then come back tomorrow.

The board will wait.

**WHEN TO RIDE AND WHEN TO REST**

**RIDE if:** It's a bruise. It's road rash (clean it first!). It's sore muscles. It's wounded pride.

**REST if:** There's swelling. Something hurts when you press on it. A joint doesn't move the way it should. You hit your head (even with a helmet). You feel dizzy, nauseous, or "fuzzy."

**SEE A DOCTOR if:** There's visible deformity. Pain is severe and not improving. You can't put weight on something. You hit your head hard. Any head injury symptom persists.

*[Two panels side by side. Left: Kitty with a bandaid on her elbow, getting back on the board, small determined smile. Right: Duck sitting on a bench with an ice pack on his ankle, watching the others skate, content to wait. Both are okay. Both are labeled.]*This is not being dramatic. This is being smart. Skateboarders who ignore injuries become ex-skateboarders.</p>

**WHEN YOU FEEL DEFEATED**

There will be a day—probably many days—when you think: "I can't do this."

Maybe everyone at the skatepark is better than you. Maybe you've been trying the same thing for three weeks and you can't get it. Maybe your friend learned to ollie in two days and you can't even do it after a month.

Here is the truth, and I need you to believe it:

***Comparison is a thief. Progress is personal. And everyone—everyone—started exactly where you are.***

That person doing kickflips at the park? They fell on their face for months. They wanted to quit. They had bad days. They got back on.

And the fact that you're reading this book, that you're trying, that you fell down and you're thinking about getting back up? That means you're already a skateboarder.

**THE FEAR**

*[Kitty peeking out from behind a ramp at the skatepark, big hopeful eyes, paws clasped together. Baby Skate Bunny on her board nearby, patient, one paw extended. Not pushing. Just offering.]*Fear in skateboarding is real and it is useful.</p>

Fear is your brain saying: "Hey, are you sure about this? Have you thought this through? Do you have the skills for this yet?"

Sometimes the answer is: "Yes, I'm ready, let's do this." And you push through the fear and you land the trick and it's the best feeling in the world.

Sometimes the answer is: "Actually, no, I need more practice." And you go back to the basics and you work on them and you come back another day. And that is also a victory.

Fear is not weakness. Ignoring fear is not bravery. Real bravery is *listening to the fear, making an informed decision, and acting accordingly.*

Sometimes bravery means dropping in. Sometimes bravery means walking away and coming back with more preparation.<p>Both count.

> A note for parents: When your kid has a hard fall or a hard day, resist the urge to fix it. Don't say "You're fine" (they might not be). Don't say "Get back on" (they'll decide when). Do say: "That looked rough. How are you feeling?" Do say: "I'm proud of you for trying." Do say: "Ice cream?" (Ice cream is almost always appropriate.)

**CHAPTER 8**

*SKATEPARK ETIQUETTE, OR: HOW NOT TO BE THAT PERSON*

At some point, you're going to go to a skatepark. This is exciting. This is also nerve-wracking, because skateparks have their own unwritten rules and it's possible to accidentally be very annoying without knowing it.

So let's write them down.

*[The critters at a little skatepark. Baby Skate Bunny skating a small ramp. Squirrel waiting patiently at the top for her turn. Duck rolling along the flat. Jay perched on a bench watching. Turtle slowly cruising in the background. Everyone taking turns, good vibes. A tiny pink cloud.]*

**RULE 1: DON'T SNAKE.** "Snaking" means cutting someone off, dropping in when it's not your turn, or rolling into someone's line. Watch the flow. Wait your turn. It's like a four-way stop, but with more wheels.

**RULE 2: DON'T SIT ON OBSTACLES.** That ledge, that ramp, that rail—someone wants to skate it. If you need to rest, find a bench or the edge of the park.

**RULE 3: DON'T STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING.** Don't stand at the bottom of a ramp. Don't stop in the middle of a run. Don't park yourself in the bowl. Be aware of where others are skating and stay out of their way.

page: 29

**RULE 4: BEGINNERS ARE WELCOME.** If you feel like you don't belong, you're wrong. Every single person at that park was a beginner once. Most skaters are friendly and happy to help. But do go during off-peak hours at first—early mornings and weekdays are usually quieter.

**RULE 5: PICK UP AFTER YOURSELF.** Water bottles, snack wrappers, broken pieces of board. Leave the park better than you found it.<p>**RULE 6: ENCOURAGE OTHERS.** See someone land something? A quick "nice!" or even just a nod goes a long way. The skateboarding community is built on hype. Be part of it.

> A note for parents: If you're at the park watching, please don't hover in the skating area. Find a spot to sit that's out of the flow. And if an older skater gives your kid a tip, that's not a stranger being weird—that's skateboard culture. It's how knowledge gets passed down.

**CHAPTER 9**

*A VERY BRIEF CHAPTER FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS*

Hello, grown-ups.

Your child wants to skateboard, and you are nervous. This is reasonable. Skateboarding involves concrete and gravity and your child is made of soft, breakable materials that you love very much.

Here are some things I want you to know.

*[A bigger Turtle (parent) sitting on a bench at the skatepark with a first aid kit and a slightly worried expression. Baby Turtle on a board nearby, having the absolute time of its life, tiny legs out, huge smile. The parent turtle is trying very hard to be calm.]*

**Skateboarding is genuinely good for kids.** It builds balance, coordination, persistence, resilience, creativity, and problem-solving skills. It teaches them to assess risk, manage fear, and get back up after failure. These are not just sports skills. These are life skills.

**You don't have to understand skateboarding to support it.** You don't need to know what a kickflip is. You need to show up, pay attention, and care. Drive them to the park. Sit and watch. Ask them to teach you something. (They will love this.)

**Let them fail.** This is the hardest one. Every instinct in your body will tell you to prevent the fall, catch them, make it easier. But the falls are the point. The struggle is the point. Your job is to make sure they're safe enough to fail—helmet, pads, appropriate terrain—and then let them fail.

**Celebrate effort, not outcomes.** "You tried that ten times, that's awesome" is better than "Why didn't you land it?" Every attempt is a success. Every fall is data.

**Respect their pace.** They might be cautious. They might be fearless. Neither is wrong. Don't push the cautious kid to go faster, and don't hold back the fearless kid (just make sure they're geared up). They'll find their own speed.

**It's okay if they quit and come back.** Some kids skate for two weeks, stop for six months, and then pick it back up. That's not failure. That's normal. Keep the board. They'll come back.

*Watching your kid on a skateboard is hard.*
*Your heart's in your throat the whole time.*
*But look at their face.*
*LOOK at their face.*
*That joy is worth every dime.*

*[Close-up of Baby Skate Bunny's face mid-ride: eyes squeezed shut with joy, mouth in a huge grin, ears streaming back in the wind. Pure happiness. This is the face the poem is talking about.]*

**CHAPTER 10**

*THE END, WHICH IS REALLY THE BEGINNING*

So.

You know the parts of a skateboard.

You know how to wear your gear.

You know how to fall.

You know how to stand, push, stop, and turn.

You know how to practice.

You know how to be brave.

You know how to be scared and do it anyway, or be scared and wait until you're ready.

You know that progress is not a straight line. (In skateboarding, very little is a straight line.)

You know that every skateboarder was once exactly where you are.

And now? Now you go outside.

You put on your helmet.

You put on your pads.

You set your board on the ground.

You take a breath.

And you push.

*A board beneath your feet, my dear,*
*The whole wide world ahead.*
*Some days you'll fly.*
*Some days you'll fall.*
*Some days you'll coast instead.*
*But every push is forward*
*(Even when it doesn't feel that way).*
*And every fall's a story*
*That you'll tell someone someday.*
*So go.*
*Be brave.*
*Be safe.*
*Be kind.*
*Wear your helmet. Bend your knees.*
*And remember as you roll along:*
*You're doing this. You're doing this!*
*However wobbly, you belong.*

*[Full group illustration: everyone skating together. Baby Skate Bunny leading the pack, mid-jump, ears flying. All the critters behind on their boards — Squirrel, Kitty, Duck, Turtle, Jay — in a loose happy group. Pink clouds. Big energy. This is the "However wobbly, you belong" image.]*

**THE END**

*(Now go skateboard.)*

**APPENDIX**

*FIRST AID FOR SKATEBOARDERS*

Because you're going to need this page. Keep it bookmarked.

*[Baby Skate Bunny wearing a tiny red cross hat, holding up a bandaid in one paw and a thumbs-up with the other. Small, sweet, reassuring. A little first aid kit open beside her.]*

**ROAD RASH (SCRAPES AND ABRASIONS)**

Clean it. Yes, it stings. Clean it anyway. Use soap and water, not just a rinse. Remove any debris. Apply antibiotic ointment. Cover with a bandage. Change the bandage daily. Road rash looks awful but usually heals quickly.

**BRUISES**

Ice for 15--20 minutes, wrapped in a cloth. Rest. They'll turn purple, then green, then yellow. This is your body's color wheel. It's healing.

**SPRAINS**

The old advice was RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. The newer thinking is that gentle movement is actually better than total rest—your body heals faster when blood is flowing. So: ice it for 15--20 minutes at a time to manage pain (wrapped in a cloth, never directly on skin), use compression to reduce swelling, elevate it when you can, but also try to keep moving gently within your pain tolerance. If the swelling is significant or it's not improving after a couple of days, see a doctor. Ankles are the most common skateboarding sprain.

**HEAD INJURIES**

If you hit your head, **stop skating immediately**. Even with a helmet. Watch for: headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vision changes, difficulty balancing, feeling "off." These could indicate a concussion. See a doctor. Do not return to skating until cleared. This is not optional.

**FRACTURES**

If something looks wrong, hurts badly, or you can't move it normally, go to the doctor. Wrist fractures are sneaky—they sometimes just feel like a bad sprain. When in doubt, get an X-ray.

*When in doubt: rest, ice, and a grown-up's opinion. Your body is not replaceable. Your skateboard is.*
