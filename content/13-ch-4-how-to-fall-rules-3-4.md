**RULE 3: SPREAD THE IMPACT.**

The goal is to land on the big, padded, fleshy parts of your body (thighs, butt, shoulders) rather than the small, bony, breakable parts (wrists, elbows, tailbone). If you can turn a fall into a roll or a slide, the impact gets spread across a larger area and a longer time. Physics! It's useful!

**RULE 4: THE KNEE SLIDE (YOUR SECRET WEAPON).**

If you're wearing hard-shell knee pads (and you are, because you read Chapter 2), you can drop to your knees and slide. This is how bowl and ramp skaters bail out of tricks. It looks dramatic and it works. Here's how to practice:

*[Baby Skate Bunny doing a dramatic knee slide on a smooth surface. Dust clouds behind her. Knee pads gleaming. Jay watching from the side with wide eyes, impressed. Speed lines.]*On a smooth surface (a garage, a basketball court, a kitchen floor if your parents are out and the floor is clean), put on your knee pads. Walk forward. Drop to your knees and slide. That's it. Practice it until it feels natural. The goal is to make this your default bail-out move when things go wrong.
