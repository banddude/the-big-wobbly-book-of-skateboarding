**CHAPTER 2**

*SAFETY GEAR: THE STUFF BETWEEN YOU AND<br>THE CONCRETE*

I know.

*I know.*

You want to skip this chapter.

I can feel it. You're looking at your<br>board. You're looking at this chapter about gear. You're thinking: "Can I just go ride?"

Not yet. A few more pages. I promise they're important.

Here's the thing about safety gear: the people who are the actual best at skateboarding wear it. Professional skateboarders—the ones who do the incredible things you see in videos, the ones who make it look easy, the ones who are definitely, undeniably, objectively cool—they wear helmets. They wear pads. Tony Hawk wears a helmet. Andy Anderson wears a helmet. The people who are the best at this sport protect their heads.

Because your brain is you. Your brain is every trick you'll ever learn, every joke you'll ever laugh at, every friend you'll ever make. It deserves a helmet.

**Here's what IS cool: being able to skateboard again tomorrow because you were smart today.**
