*If you should fall (and you will fall)*
*Remember as you do:*
*Get small. Get round. Protect your crown.*
*The ground will not be new.*

*[All the critters mid-fall-practice on a lawn. Duck rolling sideways. Squirrel in a tuck. Kitty doing a knee slide on the grass (it doesn't really work on grass but she's trying). Baby Skate Bunny supervising with a little clipboard. Everyone in helmets and pads.]*
