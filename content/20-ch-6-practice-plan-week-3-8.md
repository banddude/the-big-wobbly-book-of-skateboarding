**WEEK 3-4: BUILDING CONFIDENCE**

**Add to your sessions:**

•Riding over small cracks and bumps (weight forward, knees bent)

•Faster pushes and longer rides

•Tighter turns

•Riding in a circle, both directions**Your goals:**</p>

•Ride comfortably at a jogging pace

•Turn sharply enough to avoid an obstacle

•Feel relaxed on the board (you'll know because your shoulders drop)**WEEK 5-8: READY FOR MORE**</p>

**Now you can start exploring:**

•Riding up and down gentle slopes (GENTLE. I said GENTLE.)

•Kickturns (lifting the front wheels and pivoting on the back wheels)

•Riding switch (with your other foot forward—this will feel like
starting over, and that's okay)</p>

•Manuals (balancing on just the back wheels while rolling—start with
one second, then two)</p>

•Tic-tacs (quick left-right kickturns to build speed without pushing)
