**RULE 1: DON'T SNAKE.** "Snaking" means cutting someone off, dropping in when it's not your turn, or rolling into someone's line. Watch the flow. Wait your turn. It's like a four-way stop, but with more wheels.

**RULE 2: DON'T SIT ON OBSTACLES.** That ledge, that ramp, that rail—someone wants to skate it. If you need to rest, find a bench or the edge of the park.

**RULE 3: DON'T STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING.** Don't stand at the bottom of a ramp. Don't stop in the middle of a run. Don't park yourself in the bowl. Be aware of where others are skating and stay out of their way.
