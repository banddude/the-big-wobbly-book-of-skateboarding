**CHAPTER 5**

*YOUR FIRST RIDE, OR: OH NO, IT'S MOVING*

Okay. You've practiced standing. You've practiced falling. You know the parts of your board. You are wearing your gear. It is time.

Find a smooth, flat surface. A tennis court, an empty parking lot, a wide sidewalk with no cracks. Avoid hills. Avoid busy areas. Avoid anywhere a car might appear. (Cars always win in a fight with skateboards. Always.)

**PUSHING**

*[Baby Skate Bunny pushing off, one foot on the board, one foot on the ground. Wind lines behind her ears. Squirrel rolling alongside looking thrilled, mouth open. Cream background.]*

Your front foot goes on the board, angled forward, toes pointing roughly toward the nose. (Later, you'll rotate it sideways. For now, forward.)

Your back foot pushes off the ground, like you're riding a scooter. Short, gentle pushes. You don't need speed. You need control.

After you push, put your back foot on the tail, rotate your front foot sideways, and ride. Knees bent. Weight centered. Breathe.

***Common Mistake #1:*** Pushing with your front foot. Some people do this (it's called "mongo pushing") and while it works, it makes everything else harder later. Push with your back foot.

***Common Mistake #2:*** Standing too stiff. Your knees need to be your shock absorbers. Stiff legs mean every crack and pebble goes straight to your brain.

***Common Mistake #3:*** Looking at your feet. Look where you're going. Your feet will figure it out.
