**THE FEAR**

*[Kitty peeking out from behind a ramp at the skatepark, big hopeful eyes, paws clasped together. Baby Skate Bunny on her board nearby, patient, one paw extended. Not pushing. Just offering.]*Fear in skateboarding is real and it is useful.

Fear is your brain saying: "Hey, are you sure about this? Have you thought this through? Do you have the skills for this yet?"

Sometimes the answer is: "Yes, I'm ready, let's do this." And you push through the fear and you land the trick and it's the best feeling in the world.

Sometimes the answer is: "Actually, no, I need more practice." And you go back to the basics and you work on them and you come back another day. And that is also a victory.

Fear is not weakness. Ignoring fear is not bravery. Real bravery is *listening to the fear, making an informed decision, and acting accordingly.*

Sometimes bravery means dropping in. Sometimes bravery means walking away and coming back with more preparation.Both count.

> A note for parents: When your kid has a hard fall or a hard day, resist the urge to fix it. Don't say "You're fine" (they might not be). Don't say "Get back on" (they'll decide when). Do say: "That looked rough. How are you feeling?" Do say: "I'm proud of you for trying." Do say: "Ice cream?" (Ice cream is almost always appropriate.)
