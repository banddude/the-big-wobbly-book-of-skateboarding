**RULE 4: BEGINNERS ARE WELCOME.** If you feel like you don't belong, you're wrong. Every single person at that park was a beginner once. Most skaters are friendly and happy to help. But do go during off-peak hours at first—early mornings and weekdays are usually quieter.

**RULE 5: PICK UP AFTER YOURSELF.** Water bottles, snack wrappers, broken pieces of board. Leave the park better than you found it.<p>**RULE 6: ENCOURAGE OTHERS.** See someone land something? A quick "nice!" or even just a nod goes a long way. The skateboarding community is built on hype. Be part of it.

> A note for parents: If you're at the park watching, please don't hover in the skating area. Find a spot to sit that's out of the flow. And if an older skater gives your kid a tip, that's not a stranger being weird—that's skateboard culture. It's how knowledge gets passed down.
