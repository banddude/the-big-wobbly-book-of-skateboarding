*For everyone who ever fell down*

*and got back up.*

*And for everyone who fell down*

*and sat there for a while.*

*That's okay too.*

*[Small spot illustration: Baby Skate Bunny sitting on the ground next to a tipped-over skateboard, looking peaceful. Not sad. Just resting. A little cloud overhead.]*
