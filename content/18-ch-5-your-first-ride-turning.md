**TURNING**

*[Baby Skate Bunny carving a big lazy S-turn, looking relaxed and happy. Dotted line behind showing the S-path. A couple of orange cones in the background.]*

Remember how we leaned on the grass? Same thing, but now you're rolling.

Lean your toes and the board curves one way. Lean your heels and it curves the other. These are called **carving turns** and they are how you steer.

Start with big, wide, lazy turns. You are not slalom skiing. You are gently suggesting to the board that maybe, perhaps, if it's not too much trouble, it might go a little bit to the left.

As you get more comfortable, your turns will get sharper. But for now: gentle.

> A note for parents: Your job during first rides is to be a calm presence. Stand nearby. Resist the urge to hover or grab them. If they fall, wait a beat—let them decide if they need help. Say "nice!" a lot. Mean it.
