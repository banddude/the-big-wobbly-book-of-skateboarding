**CHAPTER 6**

*THE PRACTICE PLAN: WHAT TO DO AND WHEN TO DO IT*

Here's the thing nobody tells you: skateboarding is not a sport you get good at quickly. It's a sport you get good at consistently.

Fifteen minutes a day beats two hours once a week. Your body needs repetition. Your brain needs repetition. Your courage needs repetition.

Here is a practice plan. Follow it, adjust it, make it yours. But follow something.

**WEEK 1-2: THE BASICS**

**Every session should include:**

•5 minutes of falling practice (even on days you don't feel like it)

•Pushing and riding in a straight line

•Stopping (foot brake, step-off)

•Gentle turns in both directions

**Your goals:**

•Push and ride 50 feet without stepping off

•Stop on purpose within a few feet of where you intend

•Make S-turns without feeling like you're about to die
