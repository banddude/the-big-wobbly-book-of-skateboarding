**THE DECK** is the flat wooden part you stand on. It is made of layers of maple wood pressed together, which is called "ply." Most decks are 7-ply. It is strong. It has to be. It is going to hold you, your hopes, and your dreams. (And occasionally your backside, after you fall on it.) The front end is called the nose and the back end is called the tail.

**THE GRIP TAPE** is the sandpapery stuff on top of the deck. It keeps your feet from sliding off. It will also destroy your shoes. This is normal. This is expected. Shoe companies are aware of this. It is a whole economy.

**THE TRUCKS** are the metal T-shaped things on the bottom. They connect the wheels to the deck and they let you turn. Loose trucks = easier turning, more wobble. Tight trucks = harder turning, more stability. Beginners: keep them a little tighter. You have enough to worry about.

**THE WHEELS** are round. (Thank goodness.) They come in different sizes and hardnesses. Bigger, softer wheels = smoother ride over rough ground. Smaller, harder wheels = better for tricks. For learning, go bigger and softer. The sidewalk is bumpy enough already.

**THE BEARINGS** are inside the wheels and make them spin. You don't need to know much about them right now except: keep them dry. Water is the enemy of bearings. Water is the enemy of skateboarding in general. Rain is skateboarding's villain origin story.

**THE HARDWARE** is the set of nuts and bolts that hold the trucks onto the deck. There are eight of them. They are small, they are mighty, and they are absolutely going to disappear into the carpet the second you drop one.
