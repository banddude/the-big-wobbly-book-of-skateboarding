**KNEE PADS (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)**

Good knee pads aren't just protection—they're actually a falling tool. We're going to learn to fall on our knee pads on purpose. This is called a "knee slide," and it's one of the most important skills in skateboarding. Hard-shell knee pads (the kind with the plastic cap) let you slide when you fall instead of sticking and tumbling. This is a feature, not a bug.

**ELBOW PADS (RECOMMENDED)**

Like knee pads but for your elbows. Your elbows are pointy and full of nerve endings and they would like to be protected, please.

**SKATE SHOES (IMPORTANT)**Flat-soled shoes. Not running shoes (too curved). Not sandals (no). Not boots (too heavy). Flat, grippy soles that can feel the board under your feet. Vans, Etnies, Nike SB—there are lots of options. The grip tape will eat them eventually. This is the cost of doing business.

> A note for parents: Please, please, please do not make safety gear a negotiation. It's not optional at any age. And the best way to make your kid wear gear without a fight? Wear some yourself if you're out there too. Model it. Make it normal. Make it boring. Boring is the goal.
