Because you're going to need this page. Keep it bookmarked.

**ROAD RASH (SCRAPES AND ABRASIONS)**

Clean it. Yes, it stings. Clean it anyway. Use soap and water, not just a rinse. Remove any debris. Apply antibiotic ointment. Cover with a bandage. Change the bandage daily. Road rash looks awful but usually heals quickly.

**BRUISES**

Ice for 15-20 minutes, wrapped in a cloth. Rest. They'll turn purple, then green, then yellow. This is your body's color wheel. It's healing.

**SPRAINS**

The old advice was RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. The newer thinking is that gentle movement is actually better than total rest—your body heals faster when blood is flowing. So: ice it for 15-20 minutes at a time to manage pain (wrapped in a cloth, never directly on skin), use compression to reduce swelling, elevate it when you can, but also try to keep moving gently within your pain tolerance. If the swelling is significant or it's not improving after a couple of days, see a doctor. Ankles are the most common skateboarding sprain.
