**APPENDIX**

*FIRST AID FOR SKATEBOARDERS*

Because you're going to need this page. Keep it bookmarked.

**STOP SKATING RIGHT NOW IF:**

You hit your head (even with a helmet). Something looks bent or wrong. You cannot put weight on it. You feel dizzy, sick, or confused. You cannot move something that should move. There is a lot of swelling right away.

These are not "walk it off" situations. These are "tell a grown-up and possibly go to the hospital" situations.

**HEAD INJURIES**

If you hit your head, **you are done skating for the day.** No exceptions. Even with a helmet. Watch for headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vision changes, or just feeling "off." Any of those could mean a concussion. See a doctor. Do not skate again until a doctor says you can.

After a hard head impact, check your helmet too. Skate helmets (the dual-certified kind, CPSC and ASTM) are designed to handle multiple low impacts. That is why skaters use them instead of bike helmets. But if you see a crack, if the foam inside is crushed or dented, or if you took a hit hard enough to rattle your brain, replace it. A damaged helmet is decoration, not protection.

**WRIST AND ARM INJURIES**

When you fall, your instinct is to catch yourself with your hands. Everyone does it. This is why wrist fractures are the single most common skateboarding broken bone, especially in kids. This is also why we wear wrist guards.

If your wrist hurts after a fall and it is swollen or tender when you press on it, get an X-ray. Wrist fractures are sneaky. They sometimes feel like a bad sprain. When in doubt, get it checked. A fracture that heals wrong is a much bigger problem than a trip to urgent care.

**OTHER FRACTURES**

If something looks wrong, hurts badly, swells quickly, or you cannot move it normally, go to the doctor. Do not try to figure out if it is "just a sprain" on your own. That is what X-rays are for.
