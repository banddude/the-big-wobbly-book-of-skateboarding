**STOPPING**

There are three beginner-friendly ways to stop. Learn all of them.

*[Three small spot illustrations in a row: Duck doing a foot brake (dragging foot, concentrating hard). Kitty doing a step-off (walking casually away from a rolling board, tail up). Turtle doing a tail scrape (determined expression, sparks flying from the tail). Labels under each.]*

**THE FOOT BRAKE:** Take your back foot off the board and gently drag the sole of your shoe on the ground. Don't stomp. Drag. Like you're trying to flatten a very persistent bug. This is the most common beginner stop.

**THE STEP-OFF:** At low speeds, just step off the front of the board and walk. Let the board roll behind you (or step on the tail to stop it). Simple. Undramatic. Effective.

**THE TAIL SCRAPE:** Shift your weight to the back foot and press down on the tail so it drags on the ground. This wears down your tail over time, so use the foot brake more often, but it's good to know.

Practice stopping before you practice going fast. This seems obvious but I promise you at least half the people reading this were about to skip this part.
