**CHAPTER 3**

*BEFORE YOU ROLL: THE STUFF NOBODY WANTS TO DO BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD*

I know you want to get on the board right now.

I know. I see you eyeing it. It's right there. It has wheels. It's calling to you.

But we're going to spend a few minutes not riding it first, and I promise this will make everything better when you do.

**FINDING YOUR STANCE**

*[Two panels side by side: Baby Skate Bunny in "regular" stance (left foot forward), Squirrel in "goofy" stance (right foot forward). Both looking perfectly content. A little label under each: "Regular" and "Goofy." Neither is wrong.]

*You need to figure out which foot goes in front.

**Regular** means your left foot is forward. **Goofy** means your right foot is forward. Neither one is better or worse. "Goofy" is not an insult. (Well, it might be in other contexts, but not here.)

Here are three ways to figure out your stance:

**THE SLIDE TEST:** Put on socks. Stand on a smooth floor. Run and slide. Whichever foot you naturally put forward? That's your front foot.

**THE PUSH TEST:** Have someone gently push you from behind. Whichever foot you step forward with to catch yourself? Front foot.

**THE STAIR TEST:** Which foot do you naturally step up with first when you climb stairs? That's probably your front foot.

If all three tests give you different answers, go with whatever feels most comfortable. There is no wrong answer here. (This is one of very few contexts in which I will say that.)
