**CHAPTER 4**

*HOW TO FALL (THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK)*

Read that subtitle again.

**This is the most important chapter in this book.**

Not how to ollie. Not how to kickflip. How to fall. Because you are going to fall hundreds of times before you land your first trick, and the skateboarders who last are the ones who learned to fall well.

Falling well is a skill. It can be learned. And you're going to practice it right now, on purpose.

**THE GOLDEN RULES OF FALLING**

**RULE 1: NEVER CATCH YOURSELF WITH STRAIGHT ARMS.**

This is how wrists break. Straight arms + impact = all the force going into two tiny wrist joints. Instead, bend your arms and try to roll with the fall. (If you're wearing wrist guards, they help a lot, but don't rely on them alone.)

**RULE 2: TUCK AND ROLL.**

When you feel yourself falling, bend everything—knees, elbows, neck (tuck your chin!). Get small. Round. Like a ball. Balls bounce; sticks snap. Be a ball, not a stick.
