**Respect their pace.** They might be cautious. They might be fearless. Neither is wrong. Don't push the cautious kid to go faster, and don't hold back the fearless kid (just make sure they're geared up). They'll find their own speed.

**It's okay if they quit and come back.** Some kids skate for two weeks, stop for six months, and then pick it back up. That's not failure. That's normal. Keep the board. They'll come back.

*Watching your kid on a skateboard is hard.*
*Your heart's in your throat the whole time.*
*But look at their face.*
*LOOK at their face.*
*That joy is worth every dime.*

*[Close-up of Baby Skate Bunny's face mid-ride: eyes squeezed shut with joy, mouth in a huge grin, ears streaming back in the wind. Pure happiness. This is the face the poem is talking about.]*
