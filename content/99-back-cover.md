**They told you it would be easy. They lied.**

But they also told you it would be fun, and that part is absolutely true. This is the book that teaches real kids real skateboarding, one wobbly push at a time, with safety gear, stubbornness, and a squad of forest critters who believe in you.

*However wobbly, you belong.*

**What's inside:** A genuinely useful guide to skateboarding for young beginners and the grown-ups who love them. Real technique, real safety information, real practice plans, and real encouragement, all wrapped in humor and illustrated with the world's most supportive forest critters. Because learning to skateboard is hard, and hard things are better when someone makes you laugh.
