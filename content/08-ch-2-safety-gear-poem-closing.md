*A helmet on your head, my dear,*

*and knee pads on your knees.*

*Some wrist guards and some elbow gear,*

*now fall down as you please!*

*[All the critters in a row wearing helmets, looking at the reader. Deadpan expressions. Matter-of-fact. Baby Skate Bunny in the middle, arms crossed, satisfied. This is just what we do.]*
