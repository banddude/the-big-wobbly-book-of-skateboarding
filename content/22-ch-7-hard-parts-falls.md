**CHAPTER 7**

*THE HARD PARTS (AND THEY ARE VERY HARD)*

Now we need to talk about the difficult stuff.

Not the physical stuff—we've covered falling and pushing and stopping. The hard part of skateboarding is not the skateboarding.

**The hard part is the feeling.**

**WHEN YOU FALL AND IT HURTS**

You will have a bad fall. Not a cute fall. Not a funny fall. A fall where you hit the ground and it hurts and maybe you cry and maybe you feel scared and maybe you don't want to get back on the board.

This is normal.

This is so normal that every skateboarder has a story about it. Ask any skater about their worst fall and watch their eyes light up as they tell you. Because on the other side of that fall, they got back on.

But here's the important thing: **you don't have to get back on immediately.**

Sit down. Breathe. Check yourself over. Make sure nothing is actually injured (not just hurt—there's a difference, and we'll cover it below). Drink some water. Sit for five minutes or twenty minutes or the rest of the day.

Then come back tomorrow.

The board will wait.
