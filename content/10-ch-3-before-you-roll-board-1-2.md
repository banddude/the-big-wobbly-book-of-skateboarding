**GETTING TO KNOW YOUR BOARD (WITHOUT MOVING)**

Find a patch of grass or carpet. Set your board on it. The soft surface will keep it from rolling while you practice.

**STEP 1: Just Stand On It.**

Put your front foot near the front bolts (the screws you can see on top near the nose). Put your back foot near the back bolts. Stand there. Breathe. Notice that you are standing on a board and you are fine. This is good.

**STEP 2: Bend Your Knees.**

A low center of gravity is your best friend in skateboarding. (Gravity is simultaneously your best friend and your worst enemy in skateboarding. It's complicated.) Bend your knees. Keep your shoulders over your feet. Imagine you are a very relaxed, slightly crouching person who is totally in control. Because you are.
