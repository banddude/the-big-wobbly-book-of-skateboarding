**CHAPTER 9**

*A VERY BRIEF CHAPTER FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS*

Hello, grown-ups.

Your child wants to skateboard, and you are nervous. This is reasonable. Skateboarding involves concrete and gravity and your child is made of soft, breakable materials that you love very much.

Here are some things I want you to know.

**Skateboarding is genuinely good for kids.** It builds balance, coordination, persistence, resilience, creativity, and problem-solving skills. It teaches them to assess risk, manage fear, and get back up after failure. These are not just sports skills. These are life skills.

**You don't have to understand skateboarding to support it.** You don't need to know what a kickflip is. You need to show up, pay attention, and care. Drive them to the park. Sit and watch. Ask them to teach you something. (They will love this.)

**Let them fail.** This is the hardest one. Every instinct in your body will tell you to prevent the fall, catch them, make it easier. But the falls are the point. The struggle is the point. Your job is to make sure they're safe enough to fail—helmet, pads, appropriate terrain—and then let them fail.

**Celebrate effort, not outcomes.** "You tried that ten times, that's awesome" is better than "Why didn't you land it?" Every attempt is a success. Every fall is data.
