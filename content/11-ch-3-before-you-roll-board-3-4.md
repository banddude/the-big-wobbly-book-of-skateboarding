**STEP 3: Shift Your Weight.**

Lean a little toward your toes. Lean a little toward your heels. Feel how the board tips? On concrete, this is what makes you turn. Right now, on the grass, it's just getting your body used to the feeling.

**STEP 4: Practice Getting On and Off.**

Step on. Step off. Step on again. Get comfortable with the motion. Know where your feet go without looking. This is going to become automatic, but right now you're building the muscle memory.<p>Spend at least 10 minutes doing this. I know it doesn't feel like "real" skateboarding. But you know what else doesn't feel like real skateboarding? Falling off in the first three seconds because you weren't comfortable on the board.

> A note for parents: This is a great time to just be present and encouraging. "You look solid up there" is a good thing to say. "Let me get a video!" is also a good thing to say. "Why aren't you moving yet?" is not.
