**CHAPTER 10**

*THE END, WHICH IS REALLY THE BEGINNING*

So.

You know the parts of a skateboard.

You know how to wear your gear.

You know how to fall.

You know how to stand, push, stop, and turn.

You know how to practice.

You know how to be brave.

You know how to be scared and do it anyway, or be scared and wait until you're ready.

You know that progress is not a straight line. (In skateboarding, very little is a straight line.)

You know that every skateboarder was once exactly where you are.

And now? Now you go outside.

You put on your helmet.

You put on your pads.

You set your board on the ground.

You take a breath.

And you push.

The critters behind her, all rolling, all at different skill levels — Squirrel confident, Kitty a little wobbly, Duck flapping for balance, Turtle slow but steady, Jay gliding. All happy. Warm golden light. The open road ahead.]*
