**HEAD INJURIES**

If you hit your head, **stop skating immediately**. Even with a helmet. Watch for: headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vision changes, difficulty balancing, feeling "off." These could indicate a concussion. See a doctor. Do not return to skating until cleared. This is not optional.

**FRACTURES**

If something looks wrong, hurts badly, or you can't move it normally, go to the doctor. Wrist fractures are sneaky—they sometimes just feel like a bad sprain. When in doubt, get an X-ray.

*When in doubt: rest, ice, and a grown-up's opinion. Your body is not replaceable. Your skateboard is.*
