**SPRAINS**

You might hear people say "RICE" (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation). The current advice is called PEACE & LOVE: Protect it. Elevate it. Avoid anti-inflammatories for the first day or two. Compress it. Educate yourself on the injury.

Then: Load it gently, because your body heals faster when blood is flowing. Stay optimistic, because attitude actually matters. Get your heart rate up with other exercise if you can. Keep moving within your pain tolerance.

Ice can help with pain, but wrap it in a cloth (never directly on skin) and only 15-20 minutes at a time. If the swelling is significant or it is not improving after a couple of days, see a doctor. Ankles are the most common skateboarding sprain.

**ROAD RASH (SCRAPES AND ABRASIONS)**

Clean it. Yes, it stings. Clean it anyway. Use soap and water, not just a rinse. Remove any debris (a clean washcloth helps). Apply antibiotic ointment. Cover with a bandage. Change the bandage daily. Road rash looks awful but usually heals quickly.

**BRUISES**

Ice for 15-20 minutes, wrapped in a cloth. Rest. They will turn purple, then green, then yellow. This is your body's color wheel. It is healing.

**SKATING IN THE HEAT**

Drink water before you skate, while you skate, and after you skate. If you feel dizzy, nauseous, or your skin gets hot and stops sweating, get into the shade immediately and drink water. Heat exhaustion is real and it sneaks up on you, especially when you are having fun and not paying attention. Take breaks. Find shade. Bring a water bottle. This is not optional.

*When in doubt: rest, ice, and a grown-up's opinion. Your body is not replaceable. Your skateboard is.*
