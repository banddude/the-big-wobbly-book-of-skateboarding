**CHAPTER 1**

*THE SKATEBOARD: AN INTRODUCTION TO YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND / NEMESIS*

A skateboard is a deceptively simple object.

It is a piece of wood with four wheels. That's it. That's the whole thing. A toddler could describe it. And yet this simple piece of wood with four wheels has been making humans fall down in spectacular fashion since the 1950s.

Let's get to know the parts.

Labeled diagram style — arrows pointing to deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, nose, tail — but drawn in the Baby Skate Bunny style with thick outlines and soft colors.]*

> A note for parents: A complete beginner skateboard from a real skate shop (not a toy store) will run about $80–$140. The toy store boards with the cartoon characters on them look cute but they roll like shopping carts with broken wheels. Invest in a real one. Your child's ankles will thank you.
