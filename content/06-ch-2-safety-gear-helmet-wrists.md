**THE GEAR LIST**

**HELMET (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

Get a skateboard helmet certified to the ASTM F1492 standard—this is the skateboarding-specific safety standard, and it means the helmet is built to handle multiple impacts (unlike bike helmets, which are designed for a single big hit). Look for that certification on the sticker inside the helmet. Even better: find one that's dual-certified to both ASTM F1492 and CPSC. It should sit low on your forehead, about two finger-widths above your eyebrows. It should be snug. It should not wobble. If you shake your head vigorously and it moves, it's too big. (If you shake your head vigorously and it doesn't move but you get dizzy, you may have shaken too vigorously.)

Replace your helmet after any significant impact, even if it looks fine. The foam inside is designed to crush on impact—once it's crushed, it won't protect you again. A helmet is a one-hit wonder.

**WRIST GUARDS (EXTREMELY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)**

When you fall—and you will fall, this is not a threat, it is a physics-based prediction—your instinct will be to catch yourself with your hands. This is a terrible instinct, but it is a very powerful one. Wrist guards have a rigid splint that distributes the impact across your whole forearm instead of concentrating it on your wrist bones. Wrist fractures are the most common skateboarding injury. Wrist guards are cheap. Do the math.
