**WHEN TO RIDE AND WHEN TO REST**

**RIDE if:** It's a bruise. It's road rash (clean it first!). It's sore muscles. It's wounded pride.

**REST if:** There's swelling. Something hurts when you press on it. A joint doesn't move the way it should. You hit your head (even with a helmet). You feel dizzy, nauseous, or "fuzzy."

**SEE A DOCTOR if:** There's visible deformity. Pain is severe and not improving. You can't put weight on something. You hit your head hard. Any head injury symptom persists.

Skateboarders who ignore injuries become ex-skateboarders.</p>

**WHEN YOU FEEL DEFEATED**

There will be a day—probably many days—when you think: "I can't do this."

Maybe everyone at the skatepark is better than you. Maybe you've been trying the same thing for three weeks and you can't get it. Maybe your friend learned to ollie in two days and you can't even do it after a month.

Here is the truth, and I need you to believe it:

***Comparison is a thief. Progress is personal. And everyone—everyone—started exactly where you are.***

That person doing kickflips at the park? They fell on their face for months. They wanted to quit. They had bad days. They got back on.

And the fact that you're reading this book, that you're trying, that you fell down and you're thinking about getting back up? That means you're already a skateboarder.
