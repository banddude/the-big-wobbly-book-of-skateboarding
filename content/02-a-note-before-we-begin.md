**A NOTE BEFORE WE BEGIN**

*(Please actually read this part.)*

This is a real book about skateboarding.

A real, actual, genuinely useful book. It will teach you real things about a real sport that real people do on real concrete with real consequences.

It just happens to be written by someone who believes that learning does not have to be boring, and that humor and safety gear can coexist peacefully.

This book is for kids **AND** for the grown-ups who love them. Parents, guardians, cool aunts, nervous grandparents—you are all welcome here. In fact, you are *encouraged* here. Skateboarding is more fun when someone is watching and cheering (or at least standing nearby with a first aid kit and a concerned expression).

Everything in this book—the safety information, the technique instructions, the practice progression—is based on real skateboarding instruction. I've just made it more fun to read.

Because here's the thing about skateboarding: it's going to be hard. You're going to fall. You're going to want to quit. And the difference between the people who become skateboarders and the people who don't is not talent.

*It's stubbornness.*

And maybe this book.

Let's begin.
