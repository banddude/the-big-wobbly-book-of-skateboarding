*A board beneath your feet, my dear,*
*The whole wide world ahead.*
*Some days you'll fly.*
*Some days you'll fall.*
*Some days you'll coast instead.*
*But every push is forward*
*(Even when it doesn't feel that way).*
*And every fall's a story*
*That you'll tell someone someday.*
*So go.*
*Be brave.*
*Be safe.*
*Be kind.*
*Wear your helmet. Bend your knees.*
*And remember as you roll along:*
*You're doing this. You're doing this!*
*However wobbly, you belong.*

*[Full group illustration: everyone skating together. Baby Skate Bunny leading the pack, mid-jump, ears flying. All the critters behind on their boards — Squirrel, Kitty, Duck, Turtle, Jay — in a loose happy group. Pink clouds. Big energy. This is the "However wobbly, you belong" image.]*

**THE END**

*(Now go skateboard.)*
