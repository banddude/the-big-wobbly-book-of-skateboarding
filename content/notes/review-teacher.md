# Pedagogical Review: The Big Wobbly Book of Skateboarding

**Reviewer background:** Elementary/middle school curriculum design and instruction, with particular attention to scaffolded physical education content and dual-audience (child + caregiver) instructional materials.

**Overall assessment:** This is a genuinely excellent instructional book. The pedagogical structure is sound, the voice is engaging without being condescending, and the safety content is not only accurate but delivered in a way that kids will actually internalize. What follows are specific observations, both positive and areas for improvement, organized by topic.

## Pedagogical Structure and Logical Progression

The chapter sequence is strong and follows established best practices for physical skill instruction:

1. Equipment knowledge (Ch 1)
2. Safety gear (Ch 2)
3. Static practice / board familiarity (Ch 3)
4. Falling technique (Ch 4)
5. Movement skills (Ch 5)
6. Practice planning (Ch 6)
7. Emotional resilience (Ch 7)
8. Social skills / park etiquette (Ch 8)
9. Parent guidance (Ch 9)
10. Motivational close (Ch 10)
11. First aid reference (Appendix)

This is textbook scaffolding. Equipment before safety, safety before standing, standing before moving, moving before practicing, practicing before the emotional reality of struggle. The placement of "How to Fall" (Ch 4) before "Your First Ride" (Ch 5) is particularly smart. Most beginner resources rush to the exciting part. This book makes falling a prerequisite skill, which is both physically correct and psychologically powerful: it tells the reader "falling is part of this, not a failure of this."

**One structural suggestion:** Chapter 7 (The Hard Parts) covers emotional resilience, fear, injury assessment, and when to rest. This is a lot of conceptual territory for a single chapter, and it arrives after the practice plan (Ch 6). Consider whether a brief emotional check-in might also belong somewhere in Chapters 3 through 5, even a single sentence acknowledging that frustration is coming. The book does this beautifully in the "A Note Before We Begin" section with "It's stubbornness," but then the emotional content disappears until Chapter 7. A small callback in Chapter 5, during the "Common Mistakes" section or after describing pushing, could bridge that gap. Something as simple as "If this feels impossible right now, it isn't. Turn to Chapter 7 whenever you need it" would give kids permission to jump ahead to the emotional support content.

## Reading Level Appropriateness

The reading level sits comfortably in the upper elementary range (roughly grades 3 through 6), which is appropriate for the target audience. The sentence structures vary well between short punchy statements and longer explanatory ones, which keeps the rhythm engaging and prevents fatigue.

The book does something difficult and does it well: it explains real technical concepts without dumbing them down. For example, from page 5:

> "It is made of layers of maple wood pressed together, which is called 'ply.' Most decks are 7-ply."

This introduces vocabulary naturally within context. The child learns the word "ply" and immediately gets a concrete reference point (7-ply). This is good instructional writing.

The humor operates on multiple levels, which is ideal for the dual audience. Kids will laugh at "Like you're trying to flatten a very persistent bug." Parents will laugh at "This is a whole economy" (about grip tape destroying shoes). Neither joke requires the other audience to get it for the text to work.

**One concern:** The sentence "Wrist guards have a rigid splint that distributes the impact across your whole forearm instead of concentrating it on your wrist bones" (page 7) is accurate but dense. A younger reader (age 7 or 8) may not fully parse "distributes the impact across your whole forearm instead of concentrating it on your wrist joints." Consider whether a brief analogy would help here, something like "instead of all the force hitting one small spot, it spreads out over a bigger area, like how snowshoes keep you from sinking." The physics explanation on page 14 ("the impact gets spread across a larger area and a longer time. Physics! It's useful!") handles this same concept more accessibly. The wrist guard explanation could benefit from a similar approach.

## Scaffolding: Does Each Chapter Build on the Previous?

Yes, and it does so explicitly, which is important for self-directed learners. Chapter 5 opens with: "You've practiced standing. You've practiced falling. You know the parts of your board. You are wearing your gear." This kind of recap/checklist before introducing new material is a proven instructional technique. It tells the reader "you are ready for this because you did the previous things."

The practice plan in Chapter 6 reinforces this scaffolding by organizing skills into timed progressions. Week 1-2 references only skills from Chapters 3 through 5. Weeks 3-4 build on those. Weeks 5-8 introduce new concepts (kickturns, manuals, tic-tacs). This is well structured.

**Issue:** The Week 5-8 section (page 21) introduces several terms without prior explanation:

- "Kickturns (lifting the front wheels and pivoting on the back wheels)" receives a parenthetical definition, which is good.
- "Manuals (balancing on just the back wheels while rolling)" also receives one, good.
- "Tic-tacs (quick left-right kickturns to build speed without pushing)" also defined.
- "Riding switch (with your other foot forward)" is defined.

These are all handled with inline definitions, which works. However, "riding switch" is a significant concept that changes the entire feel of skating. The parenthetical "(this will feel like starting over, and that's okay)" is helpful but could be expanded slightly. A child who has spent 4 weeks building confidence may feel genuinely distressed when switch riding makes them feel like a beginner again. A sentence or two acknowledging this more fully, or a forward reference to Chapter 7's emotional content, would strengthen the scaffolding.

## Clarity of Instructions

The step-by-step instructions are generally clear and well-sequenced. The "Getting to Know Your Board" section (pages 11-12) is a model of good physical instruction writing:

1. Set up the environment (grass or carpet)
2. Do the simplest version of the skill (just stand)
3. Add one element (bend knees)
4. Add another element (shift weight)
5. Practice transitions (on and off)

This is exactly how a good PE teacher would structure a lesson.

**Areas where clarity could improve:**

**Pushing (page 17):** The instruction "Your front foot goes on the board, angled forward, toes pointing roughly toward the nose" is clear. But the next instruction, "After you push, put your back foot on the tail, rotate your front foot sideways, and ride," describes three actions in one sentence. For a physical skill being learned in real time, this would benefit from being broken into numbered sub-steps:

1. Push with your back foot
2. Place your back foot on the tail
3. Rotate your front foot sideways
4. Bend your knees and ride

A child reading this while standing next to their board needs to be able to glance down, read one step, do it, then read the next. The current paragraph format makes that harder than it needs to be.

**Turning (page 19):** "Lean your toes and the board curves one way. Lean your heels and it curves the other." This is correct but could confuse a child who takes "lean your toes" literally (leaning the toes themselves rather than shifting weight toward the toe side). Consider "Lean toward your toes" or "Press down on your toe side" for precision.

**Falling practice (page 15):** The tuck and roll instruction says "fall forward and roll over your shoulder. (Like a somersault, but starting from the side.)" This is a complex physical movement described in one sentence. For safety-critical content, more detail would be valuable. Which shoulder? How do you protect your head during the roll? The instruction to "tuck your chin" appears in Rule 2 (page 13) but is not repeated here in the actual practice steps where the child is performing the movement. Repeating "chin tucked" in step 2 of the falling practice would be a meaningful safety reinforcement.

## Vocabulary Consistency

Vocabulary usage is generally consistent throughout. A few observations:

**"Nose" and "tail":** Introduced on page 5, used consistently afterward. Good.

**"Regular" and "goofy":** Introduced on page 10, used again on page 21 ("riding switch"). The relationship between stance and switch riding could be made more explicit. A child who learned they are "regular" may not immediately connect that "riding switch" means riding goofy, and vice versa.

**"Bail"/"bail out":** Used on page 14 ("bail out of tricks") without prior definition. This is skate-specific vocabulary. While context makes the meaning clear, a brief parenthetical on first use would be consistent with how other terms are handled.

**"Line":** Used on page 28 ("rolling into someone's line") without definition. In skatepark context, "line" means a planned path or sequence. A child visiting a park for the first time would benefit from knowing this. Consider: "rolling into someone's line (the path they're skating)."

**"Dropping in":** Used on page 25 ("Sometimes bravery means dropping in") without explanation. This is a specific skateboarding technique (entering a ramp or bowl from the top edge). A child reading sequentially who hasn't been to a park yet won't know what this means. A brief parenthetical would help: "dropping in (rolling into a ramp from the top)."

**"Bowl":** Used on page 14 ("bowl and ramp skaters") and page 28 ("Don't park yourself in the bowl"). Never defined. Consider adding a brief description on first use, since this book's audience may never have seen one.

## Information Density Per Page

The density is mostly well calibrated, but there are a few spots worth noting.

**Page 5 (skateboard parts):** This is the densest page in the book, covering six components (deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, bearings, hardware) with descriptions of each. For a children's book format at 380x380px, this is a lot of text on one page. The illustration note at the bottom suggests a small spot illustration, but this page might benefit from being split into two pages, or from having an accompanying labeled diagram that carries some of the explanatory weight. The reader is being asked to learn six new concepts on a single page, which is at the upper limit of what's pedagogically advisable for this age group.

**Pages 7-8 (safety gear details):** Similarly dense, but the life-safety nature of the content justifies it. The information here is critical and should not be cut.

**Page 34 (appendix, first aid):** Very dense, but this functions as a reference page rather than a read-through page, so density is appropriate. The "STOP SKATING RIGHT NOW IF" section is well formatted for quick scanning.

**Pages 20-21 (practice plan):** Good density. The bullet-point format is easy to scan and revisit, which is exactly how a practice plan should work.

**Page 24 (ride vs. rest + defeat):** This page covers two distinct topics, injury assessment and emotional defeat, that are both important but quite different in nature. The transition from "bruises and swelling" to "feeling defeated" is abrupt. These could benefit from a visual separator or from being on separate pages, because a child flipping to this page for injury guidance doesn't need the emotional content at that moment, and a child seeking emotional support doesn't need the injury triage list.

## Practice Plans (Chapter 6)

The practice plans are realistic and well structured for self-directed learning. Specific strengths:

- **Time-based rather than achievement-based.** "15 minutes a day beats two hours once a week" is excellent advice and sets appropriate expectations.
- **Falling practice is included in every session.** This reinforces the book's central message that falling is a skill, not a failure.
- **Goals are concrete and measurable.** "Push and ride 50 feet without stepping off" and "Stop on purpose within a few feet of where you intend" are testable benchmarks a child can self-assess.
- **The humor in the goals helps.** "Make S-turns without feeling like you're about to die" is funny and also gives the child permission to feel scared.

**Suggestions:**

**Week 1-2:** The plan says "5 minutes of falling practice (even on days you don't feel like it)" but does not specify which falling exercises from Chapter 4. A forward reference ("See page 15 for the exercises") or a brief recap would help a child who is flipping directly to the practice plan.

**Week 3-4:** "Riding over small cracks and bumps (weight forward, knees bent)" introduces a new technique (weight forward over obstacles) that is not covered anywhere else in the book. This is the only mention of weight distribution for obstacles. For a skill that can cause falls if done wrong (weight backward over a crack catches the front wheels and throws the rider forward), this deserves more than a parenthetical. Even two sentences in Chapter 5 about how to handle rough ground would fill this gap.

**Week 5-8:** The jump from Week 4 to Week 5 is significant. The child goes from "ride comfortably at a jogging pace" to kickturns, manuals, and switch riding. Consider adding a readiness checklist, something like "Before starting Week 5, you should be able to: ride comfortably for 5 minutes straight, stop confidently using two methods, turn in both directions without hesitation." This gives the child (and parent) a way to self-assess whether they're actually ready for the next phase.

**Week 9+ (the ollie):** The book acknowledges this is beyond its scope, which is honest and appropriate. The historical detail about Alan Gelfand and Rodney Mullen is a nice touch that rewards the reader's curiosity. However, the line "that's another chapter for another day. (Or another book.)" could leave a motivated child feeling abandoned right at the point of maximum excitement. Consider adding a brief recommendation of where to go next, whether that's YouTube channels, local skate shops that offer lessons, or a specific follow-up resource. Even "ask someone at your local skate shop to show you, they love that" would give the child a next step.

## Dual Audience Effectiveness (Child + Parent)

This is one of the book's greatest strengths. The parent notes are consistently excellent. They are:

- Clearly separated from the child-facing content (blockquote format)
- Practical and specific ("Don't say 'You're fine.' Do say: 'That looked rough. How are you feeling?'")
- Respectful of both the parent's anxiety and the child's autonomy
- Distributed throughout the book rather than siloed in one chapter

The parent-specific chapter (Ch 9) is well placed near the end, after the parent has already been addressed throughout. It functions as a summary and deepening rather than a first introduction.

**Observations:**

**The gear purchasing note (page 4):** "$80 to $140" for a beginner board is useful, specific, and exactly the kind of information a parent needs. This is well placed on the very first content page.

**The parent note on page 8:** "Please, please, please do not make safety gear a negotiation" is direct, important, and perfectly placed after the gear list so the parent has context for why this matters. The advice to model gear-wearing is research-backed and practical.

**The parent note on page 25 (fear):** "Don't say 'You're fine' (they might not be). Don't say 'Get back on' (they'll decide when)." This is outstanding guidance. It treats the child as a person with agency, which is both developmentally appropriate and emotionally intelligent. The "(Ice cream is almost always appropriate)" line is a perfect tonal beat that acknowledges the heaviness of the content without undermining it.

**One gap:** There is no parent note in the first aid appendix. Given that this is the section most likely to be consulted during a stressful moment, a brief note to parents about staying calm, assessing before reacting, and when to call for emergency help versus when to handle it at home would be valuable. Something addressing the parent's emotional state during their child's injury, not just the clinical steps.

## Specific Suggestions by Section

### A Note Before We Begin (page 3)

The line "Parents, guardians, cool aunts, nervous grandparents" is warm and inclusive. Consider whether "older siblings" or "coaches" should also be named, since many kids skate with older siblings or in lesson contexts.

### Chapter 1, page 5 (parts)

"Loose trucks = easier turning, more wobble. Tight trucks = harder turning, more stability. Beginners: keep them a little tighter." This is good advice but could use one practical sentence about how to adjust truck tightness. A child holding a skate tool for the first time won't know which direction to turn the kingpin nut. "Turn the big nut in the middle of the truck clockwise to tighten" would make this actionable.

### Chapter 2, page 7 (helmet)

"It should sit low on your forehead, about two finger-widths above your eyebrows." Excellent, concrete, measurable instruction. This is a model of how to write physical descriptions for children.

The ASTM F1492 and CPSC certification information is important but may be more useful to parents than children. Consider whether this detail could be formatted as a parent note, with the child-facing version simplified to "Make sure it says 'skate certified' on the sticker inside."

### Chapter 3, page 10 (stance tests)

"If all three tests give you different answers, go with whatever feels most comfortable." This is honest and reassuring. The parenthetical "(This is one of very few contexts in which I will say that)" is funny and also signals to the child that precision matters elsewhere, which is good pedagogical framing.

### Chapter 5, page 17 (mongo pushing)

"Some people do this (it's called 'mongo pushing') and while it works, it makes everything else harder later." This is accurate and well handled. It names the thing without shaming it. A child who has already been mongo pushing won't feel attacked, and a child who hasn't will know to avoid it. This is a tricky pedagogical balance and the book handles it well.

### Chapter 6, page 20 (practice goals)

"Stop on purpose within a few feet of where you intend." This is a great goal but "a few feet" is vague for a child. Consider "within about 3 steps of where you want to stop" or some other child-scaled measurement.

### Chapter 7, page 24 (comparison)

"Comparison is a thief. Progress is personal." This is the emotional thesis of the book and it lands perfectly. No changes suggested. This is the sentence kids will remember.

### Chapter 8, page 28 (snaking)

"It's like a four-way stop, but with more wheels." Great analogy, but many children in the target age range (8 to 10) may not yet drive or fully understand four-way stop etiquette. Consider whether a school hallway or playground analogy might land better: "It's like cutting in line, but faster and more dangerous."

### Appendix, page 35 (PEACE & LOVE)

The PEACE & LOVE protocol is current and accurate (replacing the older RICE guidance). However, the acronym is presented without fully spelling it out. The text covers Protect, Elevate, Avoid anti-inflammatories, Compress, and Educate, but then switches to the LOVE portion (Load, Optimism, Vascularization, Exercise) without identifying those as the acronym's second half. Since this is reference material a parent might actually use, spelling out both halves completely would improve utility.

## Summary

This book does several things that are pedagogically rare and genuinely valuable:

1. It teaches falling as a prerequisite skill rather than an afterthought.
2. It addresses the emotional experience of learning alongside the physical skills.
3. It respects children's intelligence without overwhelming them.
4. It integrates parent guidance throughout rather than segregating it.
5. It is honest about difficulty without being discouraging.

The areas for improvement are mostly at the detail level: a few dense pages that could be split, a handful of undefined terms, some multi-step instructions that would benefit from numbered formatting, and a few spots where a brief cross-reference or forward pointer would strengthen the scaffolding.

The voice is consistent, warm, funny, and trustworthy. A child reading this book will feel spoken to, not spoken at. A parent reading alongside will feel included and equipped. That is a difficult balance to strike and this manuscript strikes it well.

This book is ready for publication with minor revisions. The instructional content is sound, the safety information is accurate and current, and the emotional framework is developmentally appropriate and genuinely moving. The "However wobbly, you belong" message is not just a tagline. It is the pedagogical philosophy of the entire book, and it is delivered consistently from cover to close.
