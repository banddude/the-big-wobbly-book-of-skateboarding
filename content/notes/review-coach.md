# Coach's Review: The Big Wobbly Book of Skateboarding

**Reviewer:** Youth skateboarding coach, 12+ years teaching ages 5 through 14, from first-timers through competition level.

**Overall impression:** This is one of the best beginner skateboarding books I have read for this age group. The progression is almost exactly how I teach, the safety messaging hits the sweet spot, and the emotional content in Chapter 7 is genuinely valuable in a way most instructional books never attempt. What follows are specific technical notes, things I would adjust, and a few gaps I would want filled before this goes to print.


## Skill Progression Order

The order is correct and matches standard coaching progression:

1. Know your equipment (Ch 1)
2. Gear up (Ch 2)
3. Static balance and stance (Ch 3)
4. Falling (Ch 4)
5. Pushing, stopping, turning (Ch 5)
6. Structured practice (Ch 6)

This is how I teach. The only thing I would consider moving is the stance discovery section. In my experience, I have kids figure out their stance *before* they even touch the board, ideally at home or in the classroom. The book currently puts stance discovery and board familiarization in the same chapter (Ch 3), which works fine on paper, but I would add a small note suggesting kids figure out their stance before they even get to the skate spot. That way when they arrive with the board, they already know which foot goes forward and they can focus entirely on balance.

**Specific suggestion:** In `09-ch-3-before-you-roll-stance.md`, after the three stance tests, consider adding one sentence: "Figure this out at home before your first session, so you're not standing in the parking lot trying to remember which foot goes where."


## Technique Descriptions: Accuracy and Detail

### Pushing (Ch 5, page 17)

The description is accurate. Front foot angled forward, back foot pushes, then rotate and ride. This is textbook. The note about rotating the front foot sideways after pushing is important and I am glad it is there, because a lot of books skip it.

**One thing missing:** The book does not mention where on the deck the front foot should be during the push. It says "toes pointing roughly toward the nose" but does not specify placement. During the push, the front foot should be just behind the front bolts, centered on the board's width. This matters because if the foot is too far forward or off-center, the board squirts out sideways. I would add: "Center your front foot over the board, just behind the front bolts. If your foot is off to one side, the board will want to shoot out from under you."

### Mongo Pushing Warning

The mongo pushing callout in `16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md` is good:

> "Pushing with your front foot. Some people do this (it's called 'mongo pushing') and while it works, it makes everything else harder later. Push with your back foot."

This is accurate and appropriately firm without being judgmental. In my classes, I explain *why* it is harder: because you have to completely reposition both feet after every push instead of just placing your back foot. A brief "why" would strengthen this. Something like: "because your weight ends up on the wrong foot and you have to shuffle both feet into position before you can turn or stop."

### Stopping (Ch 5, page 18)

The three methods described are all legitimate beginner stops. I would change the order of presentation. The book goes: foot brake, step-off, tail scrape. I would go: **step-off first, then foot brake, then tail scrape.** Here is why: the step-off is the most natural, lowest-risk option for a true beginner at low speeds. The foot brake requires balancing on one foot while moving, which is actually a fairly advanced balance skill for someone who just learned to ride. Many of my 5 to 8 year old students cannot reliably foot brake for weeks. Leading with the step-off gives them an immediate "out" while they build up to the foot brake.

**Missing stop:** I would add the "run-off" as its own method, not just as Rule 5 in the falling chapter. In practice, running off the board forward is the single most common way beginners stop for the first several sessions. It deserves its own entry in the stopping section, even if it is just: "At low speeds, step off the front and jog it out. This is not giving up. This is smart."

Actually, Rule 5 in Ch 4 (`14-ch-4-how-to-fall-rule-5-practice.md`) covers this:

> "Sometimes, especially at low speeds, you can just... step off."

But it is buried in the falling chapter. A cross-reference from the stopping section would help: "See also Rule 5 in Chapter 4 about running it out."

### Turning (Ch 5, page 19)

The turning description is accurate but could use one more detail. The book says to lean on toes or heels, which is correct for carving turns. But it does not mention **looking where you want to go.** This is the single most effective turning tip I give beginners: turn your head and shoulders first, and the board follows. Your body goes where your eyes go. This is worth its own sentence.

**Suggested addition in `18-ch-5-your-first-ride-turning.md`:** "Here is the secret to turning: look where you want to go. Turn your head first, your shoulders will follow, and the board will follow your shoulders. Your body goes where your eyes point."

### Falling Techniques (Ch 4)

The falling chapter is excellent. The five rules are the right five rules in the right order. The emphasis on practicing falls deliberately is exactly what I do in my clinics. Most books treat falling as something that happens *to* you. This book treats it as a skill you *practice.* That is correct and important.

**One addition I would make:** The tuck and roll description says "fall forward and roll over your shoulder. (Like a somersault, but starting from the side.)" This is a good description for older kids (10+), but for younger kids (5 to 8), the shoulder roll is genuinely difficult and can cause neck injuries if done wrong. For the younger audience, I would add a note: "Younger skaters, especially under 8: focus on the squat-and-sit fall (practice 1) and the knee slide (practice 3). The shoulder roll is a more advanced falling skill that works best once you are comfortable with the basics."


## Practice Plan Review (Chapter 6)

### Week 1-2 Timeline

The goals for Week 1-2 are:

> Push and ride 50 feet without stepping off. Stop on purpose within a few feet of where you intend. Make S-turns without feeling like you're about to die.

For a kid skating 15 minutes a day (as recommended), these are realistic for ages 8 and up. For younger kids (5 to 7), double the timeline. Small kids have less leg strength, shorter attention spans, and their center of gravity relative to the board is different. A 6 year old might need 3 to 4 weeks to hit these benchmarks, and that is completely normal. I would add a note: "Younger skaters (under 8) might need twice as long for each phase. That is fine. You are not behind."

### Week 3-4 Timeline

> Ride comfortably at a jogging pace. Turn sharply enough to avoid an obstacle.

This is about right. The "riding in a circle both directions" drill is one I use and it is a great inclusion. Good.

### Week 5-8 Timeline

> Kickturns, riding switch, manuals, tic-tacs

This is where the timeline gets ambitious. Kickturns at week 5 is realistic for a naturally athletic kid who has been consistent. Manuals at week 5 is optimistic. Most of my students do not get a reliable one-second manual until 2 to 3 months in. Riding switch at week 5 is also early for most kids, though I understand putting it here as an "explore" item rather than a "master" item.

**Suggested tweak in `20-ch-6-practice-plan-week-3-8.md`:** Change the framing from "Now you can start exploring" to something like "Now you can start *trying* these. Some will click quickly. Some will take months. All of that is normal." The current phrasing "Ready for More" and "start exploring" is fine, but given how challenging manuals and switch riding actually are, a small expectation-setting note would help.

### Week 9+ and the Ollie Tease

> If you've done all the above, you are ready to start learning your first real trick: the ollie.

Week 9 for ollie readiness is realistic IF the skater has been consistent. In practice, many kids are not consistent, so it might be month 4 or 5 before they are truly ready. The book handles this well by not promising a timeline for landing the ollie itself.

The Alan Gelfand and Rodney Mullen history note is a nice touch. Kids love origin stories.


## Missing Drills and Exercises

Here are drills I use in my coaching that the book does not include. Some of these would be great additions, others might be beyond the scope of the book.

### High Priority Additions

**1. The Stationary Tick-Tock Drill.** Before trying tic-tacs while rolling (Week 5-8), have kids practice lifting the nose left and right while stationary on grass. This builds the ankle strength and tail-pressure feel they need. Could be added to the grass practice in Ch 3.

**2. The Cone Weave.** Set up 5 to 6 cones (or water bottles, shoes, whatever) in a line about 6 feet apart. Weave through them. This is one of the best drills for combining pushing, turning, and stopping, and it gives kids a concrete goal. Would fit in Week 3-4.

**3. The Stop Box.** Draw a chalk square on the ground. Push toward it and try to stop with both feet inside the box. Start big (4 feet wide), get smaller. Kids love this game and it makes stopping practice feel like a challenge rather than a chore.

**4. One-Foot Balance Glide.** Push once, then ride as far as you can on just your front foot (back foot hovering, not on the board). This builds the single-leg balance needed for pushing, foot braking, and eventually tricks. Could be added to Week 3-4.

### Lower Priority (But Useful)

**5. Board Pickup Drill.** While standing next to the board, step on the tail to pop the nose up and catch it with your hand. This is partly a trick, partly a practical skill (you need to pick up your board constantly), and kids love learning it. It also teaches tail pressure, which leads into kickturns and eventually ollies.

**6. Riding Over a Stick.** Lay a pencil or thin stick on the ground. Ride over it. This teaches weight distribution and the instinct to lift your front wheels slightly over obstacles, which is a precursor to the "riding over small cracks and bumps" drill already listed in Week 3-4.


## Safety Messaging

### Overall Assessment

The safety messaging in this book is excellent. It is thorough without being preachy, firm without being scary, and it respects the intelligence of both kids and parents. The helmet section is one of the best I have seen in a children's book because it gives the *reason* (ASTM F1492, multiple impacts vs. single impact) rather than just saying "wear a helmet because I said so."

### The Balance Between Careful and Fearless

The book nails this. The key passages that get it right:

From Ch 4 (`14-ch-4-how-to-fall-rule-5-practice.md`): "There is no shame in stepping off. You are not giving up. You are making a tactical decision."

From Ch 7 (`24-ch-7-hard-parts-fear.md`): "Sometimes bravery means dropping in. Sometimes bravery means walking away and coming back with more preparation. Both count."

These are exactly the messages I try to instill in my students. Skateboarding culture sometimes pushes a "send it" mentality that leads to injuries in beginners. This book pushes a "be brave AND be smart" mentality, which is the correct approach for this age group.

### One Gap in Safety Messaging

**Skating alone vs. with a buddy.** The book never explicitly says "do not skate alone, especially when you are learning." For kids under 10, this is an important safety point. If you fall and hit your head, or break a wrist, you need someone nearby who can get help. I would add a brief note in Chapter 2 or Chapter 5: "Always skate with a friend or have a grown-up nearby, especially while you are learning. If something goes wrong, you want someone there who can help."

**Skating surface hazards.** The book says "find a smooth, flat surface" and "avoid hills," which is good. But it does not mention checking the surface for pebbles, sand, wet spots, or cracks before skating. A small pebble can lock a wheel and send a beginner flying. This is worth one sentence: "Before you start, walk the area and clear away any pebbles, sticks, or debris. A tiny rock can stop a wheel dead and send you forward fast."


## Common Beginner Mistakes Not Addressed

The book covers three common mistakes in the pushing section (mongo, stiff legs, looking at feet). These are good choices. Here are a few more that I see constantly and the book does not mention:

**1. Leaning back when scared.** When beginners get nervous, they lean back. This shifts weight off the front truck, makes the board squirrely, and often causes the board to shoot forward while the rider falls backward. This is the most common beginner fall pattern. Worth a callout in Ch 5: "When you feel nervous, your instinct is to lean back. Fight that instinct. Keep your weight centered or slightly forward. Leaning back is what makes the board shoot out from under you."

**2. Stepping off backward.** When beginners bail, they sometimes step off the back of the board instead of the front. This is dangerous because the board rockets forward (potentially into someone else) and the rider falls backward. The step-off description says "step off the front," which is correct, but it does not warn against stepping off the back. Worth a note: "Always step off toward the front, the direction you are already moving. Never step off the back."

**3. Putting the board on a slope without realizing it.** New skaters set their board down on what looks like flat ground, but is actually a slight downhill. They step on and immediately start rolling faster than expected. I would add to the "find a smooth, flat surface" advice: "Set your board down and see if it rolls on its own. If it does, you are on a slope. Find flatter ground."

**4. Grabbing onto someone when falling.** Beginners who skate near friends or parents will instinctively grab the nearest person when they lose balance. This takes both people down. Worth mentioning in the falling chapter: "If you feel yourself falling, do NOT grab onto a person next to you. You will pull them down too. Use your falling skills instead."


## Specific Technique Assessments

### Is the Foot Brake the Best Beginner Stop?

The foot brake is the standard recommendation and the book is correct to include it. However, as noted above, for very young beginners (5 to 7), the step-off and run-off are more immediately accessible. The foot brake requires single-leg balance on a moving board, which is a skill that itself needs to be developed. The book should present the step-off first for this reason.

### Are the Turning Instructions Sufficient?

The carving turn description is correct but incomplete. Adding the "look where you want to go" tip would make it significantly more useful. I would also add one sentence about speed: "Turns are easier with a little speed. If you are barely rolling, the board will not respond well to leaning. Give yourself two or three pushes before trying to turn."

### Is the Pushing Technique Description the Best for Beginners?

Yes. The description matches standard instruction. The front-foot-forward, push-with-back-foot, rotate-and-ride sequence is correct. The only addition I would make is the foot placement detail mentioned above.


## The Ollie Tease (Ch 6, page 22)

### Is This the Right Aspiration Goal?

Yes. The ollie is universally recognized as the gateway trick, and framing it as the next step is exactly right. It gives the reader something to work toward without overwhelming them.

### Should More Be Said?

No. The book handles this perfectly by teasing the ollie without teaching it. Here is why: ollie instruction requires detailed step-by-step breakdown with timing, foot positioning, board leveling, and a lot of nuance that would need its own chapter (or its own book, as the author jokes). Trying to cram ollie instruction into a closing page would do more harm than good, because kids would skip all the fundamentals and go straight to the ollie page.

The line "But that's another chapter for another day. (Or another book.)" is the right call. It leaves the door open for a sequel while keeping this book focused on the foundations that actually matter.

### One Small Suggestion

In `21-ch-6-practice-plan-week-9.md`, after mentioning the ollie, I would add one practical sentence: "Before you start learning the ollie, make sure you can do a solid kickturn and a one-second manual. These skills build the tail pressure and board control you will need." This gives the reader a concrete readiness checklist rather than just a vague "if you've done all the above."


## The Appendix: First Aid

### Accuracy

The first aid information is medically sound. The PEACE & LOVE protocol for sprains is current and correct (replacing the older RICE protocol). The head injury guidance is appropriately cautious. The "stop skating right now if" list is accurate.

### One Addition

**Tooth injuries.** Skateboarding face-plants are a reality, and a knocked-out or chipped tooth is something parents need to know how to handle. Brief guidance: "If a permanent tooth gets knocked out, hold it by the crown (not the root), rinse gently with milk or saliva, and get to a dentist within 30 minutes. Time matters. If it is a baby tooth, do not try to put it back in, just see a dentist."

### The Heat Section

Good that this is included. Many skate instruction resources ignore environmental factors entirely. I would add one line about **hot surfaces:** "In summer, metal ramps and dark pavement get extremely hot. Touch the surface with your hand before skating on it. If it is too hot to touch, it is too hot to fall on."


## The Emotional Content (Chapter 7)

This is not a typical section for a technique review, but I need to call it out because it is the most valuable part of the book from a coaching perspective.

The sections on fear, defeat, and the parent guidance around hard falls are exactly what I wish every skating parent would read. In particular:

> "Don't say 'You're fine' (they might not be). Don't say 'Get back on' (they'll decide when)."

This is advice I give parents at every single clinic and camp. Most parents, with the best intentions, either minimize the fall or push the kid to get back on immediately. Both responses can damage a child's relationship with the sport. The book's approach of validating the experience and letting the kid decide when to return is exactly right.

The "comparison is a thief" passage is also important. Skatepark culture can be intimidating for beginners, and kids comparing themselves to more experienced skaters is one of the top reasons they quit.


## Summary of Recommended Changes

Ranked by importance:

1. **Add "look where you want to go" to the turning section** (Ch 5, page 19). Single most impactful instructional addition.
2. **Add "lean forward, not back" warning** as a Common Mistake in Ch 5. Addresses the most common beginner fall pattern.
3. **Add "skate with a buddy" safety note** in Ch 2 or Ch 5.
4. **Add "check the surface for pebbles/debris" note** in Ch 5.
5. **Reorder stopping methods:** step-off first, foot brake second, tail scrape third.
6. **Add front foot placement detail** to pushing section.
7. **Add "never step off backward" warning** to stopping section.
8. **Add age-adjusted timeline note** to the practice plan for younger skaters.
9. **Add a readiness checklist** before the ollie (kickturn + manual as prerequisites).
10. **Add the stationary tick-tock drill** to grass practice in Ch 3.
11. **Add "why" to the mongo pushing warning.**
12. **Add shoulder roll age caveat** to falling practice in Ch 4.
13. **Add tooth injury guidance** to the appendix.
14. **Add hot surface warning** to the appendix heat section.

None of these are deal-breakers. The book is solid as-is. These are refinements that would make an already good instructional book even more useful in practice. The voice, the humor, the emotional content, and the overall structure are all working. This is a book I would recommend to parents at my clinics.
