| **Child Psychologist** (ages 6-12 specialist) | Developmental appropriateness, fear/failure messaging, growth mindset, parent dynamics | `review-psychologist.md` |
| **Teacher/Educator** (curriculum designer) | Pedagogical structure, reading level, scaffolding, information density, clarity of instructions | `review-teacher.md` |
| **Youth Skating Coach** (hundreds of kids taught) | Skill progression, technique accuracy, practice plan realism, safety balance, missing drills | `review-coach.md` |
| **Children's Author** (award-winning nonfiction) | Voice, tone, humor, pacing, character use, poems, emotional arc, illustration notes | `review-childrens-author.md` |

## Ground Rules for Reviewers

- Do NOT rewrite Mike's content. The voice and humor are his.
- Be specific. Cite exact text and section/page references.
- Be honest and direct. This is a real book being published.
- Suggest fixes, don't just flag problems.
- No em dashes. Use commas instead.

## How to Use These Reports

1. Read each report independently
2. Look for themes that multiple experts flag (those are highest priority)
3. Decide which suggestions align with the book's vision
4. Implement changes one section at a time
