# Nose/Tail content (cut from ch1 parts page)

The front end is called the nose and the back end is called the tail. The nose is usually a little wider and steeper. To tell them apart, look at the bolts where the trucks attach, the end with more board sticking out past the bolts is the nose. On some boards it is hard to tell, and that is okay. If you cannot tell, it probably does not matter much. You could always ask an experienced skater at the park. They love talking about this stuff.
