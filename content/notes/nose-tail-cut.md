# Content for potential additional pages (cut or deferred)

The front end is called the nose and the back end is called the tail. The nose is usually a little wider and steeper. To tell them apart, look at the bolts where the trucks attach, the end with more board sticking out past the bolts is the nose. On some boards it is hard to tell, and that is okay. If you cannot tell, it probably does not matter much. You could always ask an experienced skater at the park. They love talking about this stuff.

## Board sizing (deferred, reviewers flagged as missing)

Multiple reviewers noted the book has no board sizing guidance. Parents will ask "what size board does my kid need?" Board sizing info could live here as its own half-page or get folded into a "buying your first board" section. Does NOT need to go on the parts page (already too dense).

Key info to cover:
- Deck width is the main sizing decision (7.0" to 8.0" for kids, based on shoe size and height)
- Narrower decks (7.0-7.5") for smaller/younger kids, wider (7.5-8.0") for bigger kids
- "Ask the shop to help you pick the right size" is the safest advice
- Complete vs. building your own: beginners should buy a complete
- Could pair with updated price guidance (current $80-$140 range may be low)
