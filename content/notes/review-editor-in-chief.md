**Reviewer:** Senior Editor, Children's Nonfiction Division
**Date:** February 2026
**Manuscript format:** 35 pages, illustrated children's nonfiction (instructional)

## Overall Assessment

This is a genuinely good manuscript. The voice is distinctive, warm, and funny without undermining the instructional content. The author has solved one of the hardest problems in children's nonfiction: making safety-critical information feel neither preachy nor boring. The humor is earned, the safety content is accurate and thorough, and the emotional core of the book (particularly Chapter 7) is surprisingly powerful for a skateboarding guide.

This manuscript is not ready for publication today, but it is close. What follows are the specific issues that need attention.

---

## Structure and Organization

The chapter sequence is logical and well-considered:

1. The Skateboard (equipment knowledge)
2. Safety Gear (protection)
3. Before You Roll (stance, static practice)
4. How to Fall (the book's thesis statement, essentially)
5. Your First Ride (movement)
6. The Practice Plan (progression)
7. The Hard Parts (emotional resilience)
8. Skatepark Etiquette (social skills)
9. For Parents (dedicated grown-up chapter)
10. The End (send-off)
11. Appendix (first aid)

This progression makes pedagogical sense: gear before skills, falling before riding, basics before progression, emotional support before sending kids out into the social environment of a skatepark. The author clearly understands instructional sequencing.

**One structural concern:** Chapter 9 ("A Very Brief Chapter for Parents and Guardians") feels slightly redundant given the parent notes scattered throughout every other chapter. By the time a parent reaches Chapter 9, they have already received substantial guidance via the sidebar notes. The chapter doesn't add much that hasn't been said. More on this below.

---

## Redundancy

There are a few areas where information is repeated more than necessary:

**1. "You will fall" / falling is inevitable.** This message appears in:
- The opening note ("You're going to fall. You're going to want to quit.")
- Chapter 2 opener ("When you fall, and you will fall")
- Chapter 4 title and opening ("you are going to fall hundreds of times")
- Chapter 4 closing practice section ("every professional skateboarder has done this")
- Chapter 5 ("you will fall, this is not a threat, it is a physics-based prediction" is actually from Ch 2, but the sentiment echoes through Ch 5)
- Chapter 7 ("You will have a bad fall")
- Chapter 10 ("Some days you'll fall")

The repetition is partly intentional and partly thematic. It works as a motif. But there are moments where it crosses from deliberate reinforcement into the reader thinking "yes, I know, you've said this." I would suggest one careful pass specifically to vary the language around falling. The message should recur; the exact phrasing should not.

**2. Wrist injury information.** Wrist fractures as the most common skateboarding injury appears in:
- Chapter 2, page 7 ("Wrist fractures are the most common skateboarding injury.")
- Appendix, page 34 ("wrist fractures are the single most common skateboarding broken bone, especially in kids")

The Chapter 2 mention is fine as motivation for wearing wrist guards. The Appendix mention is fine as medical context. But the near-identical phrasing makes it feel like a copy-paste rather than a deliberate callback. Consider varying the language slightly.

**3. Knee slide instruction.** The knee slide is taught in Chapter 4, Rule 4 (page 14) and then referenced in the Chapter 4 practice section (page 15). This is fine and appropriate. But it could benefit from a brief callback in the Practice Plan (Chapter 6) to reinforce that falling practice should continue beyond Week 1.

---

## Gaps and Missing Content

**1. No "Where to Skate" section.** The book tells kids to find "a smooth, flat surface" (Chapter 5) and eventually go to a skatepark (Chapter 8), but there is no dedicated discussion of where beginners should and should not skate. A short section covering: driveways, parking lots (when empty, with a spotter), tennis courts, bike paths, sidewalk considerations, and where NOT to skate (streets, steep hills, wet surfaces) would be valuable. This could slot in before Chapter 5 or as an early section within it.

**2. No mention of board maintenance.** The book describes all the parts in Chapter 1 but never discusses basic upkeep: tightening hardware, cleaning bearings, when to replace grip tape, when a deck is done. Even a half-page would serve readers well, especially parents who may not know when equipment needs attention.

**3. Weather and surface conditions.** Rain is mentioned once in Chapter 1 ("Rain is skateboarding's villain origin story") but there is no practical guidance about wet surfaces, leaves, sand, gravel, or temperature effects on wheels. These are real hazards for beginners. The "Skating in the Heat" section at the end of the Appendix partially addresses this, but cold weather, wet conditions, and debris deserve mention somewhere in the main text.

**4. No age guidance.** The book says it is "for kids" but never specifies a recommended starting age. Parents will want to know: is this for a 5-year-old? An 8-year-old? A 12-year-old? The content reads as most appropriate for roughly ages 7 to 12, but the book should say so, either in the opening note or in the parent chapter.

**5. No mention of skateboarding with others.** The skatepark chapter covers etiquette, but there is nothing about skating with friends in a neighborhood context, being visible to drivers, or the buddy system for safety. For a book that targets kids, some guidance on skating with a friend (especially for younger readers) seems warranted.

**6. Board sizing.** Chapter 1 mentions that a beginner board costs $80 to $140 but does not discuss deck width relative to shoe size or rider height. This is one of the first questions a parent will have at a skate shop. Even a brief note ("ask the shop to help size the deck to your kid") would help.

---

## Consistency

**Terminology:** Generally excellent. The book uses consistent terms for board parts, gear, and techniques throughout.

**One inconsistency:** In the Appendix (page 34), the text says "Skate helmets (the dual-certified kind, CPSC and ASTM)" but in Chapter 2 (page 7), the certification is given as "ASTM F1492" first, then "dual-certified to both ASTM F1492 and CPSC." The Appendix drops the specific ASTM number. These should match. I recommend using the full "ASTM F1492 and CPSC" in both places for clarity and so parents can search for the exact standard.

**Tone:** Remarkably consistent. The voice holds from cover to appendix. The humor never undercuts the safety content, and the safety content never kills the humor. This is the manuscript's greatest strength.

**Formatting:** The parent notes use blockquote formatting ("> A note for parents:") consistently. The illustration notes use italic brackets consistently. Chapter titles follow a consistent pattern. Poems are formatted consistently. This is clean work.

**One formatting note:** The `<br>` tags in Chapter 2's opener (page 6) appear to be artifacts of web rendering. These should be removed or converted to standard line breaks for the print manuscript.

**Another formatting note:** The `~~` markup on page 6 ("~~ Here's what IS cool...") appears to be a stray markdown artifact. It renders as strikethrough in standard markdown, which is clearly not the intent. This needs to be cleaned up.

---

## Title and Chapter Naming

**The main title** is excellent. "The Big Wobbly Book of Skateboarding" is memorable, searchable, age-appropriate, and captures the tone perfectly. The subtitle, "A Real, Actual, Legitimate Guide (With Only Moderate Amounts of Silliness)," is charming and sets expectations well.

**Chapter titles** are strong across the board:
- "The Skateboard: An Introduction to Your New Best Friend / Nemesis" (great)
- "Safety Gear: The Stuff Between You and the Concrete" (perfect)
- "How to Fall (The Most Important Chapter in This Book)" (bold and correct)
- "The Hard Parts (And They Are Very Hard)" (honest)
- "Skatepark Etiquette, or: How Not to Be That Person" (funny and clear)

**One weak title:** "The Practice Plan: What to Do and When to Do It" (Chapter 6) is functional but lacks the personality of the other titles. Something with more voice would better match the rest of the book.

**One concern:** "A Very Brief Chapter for Parents and Guardians" (Chapter 9) announces itself as brief, which sets an expectation that the content is minor. Given that this is supposed to be the dedicated parent chapter, calling it "very brief" somewhat undermines its importance. It is also two full pages, which is not especially brief relative to other chapters.

---

## The Dedication and Opening Note

**The dedication** is perfect. Warm, inclusive, funny in the right way. "And for everyone who fell down and sat there for a while. That's okay too." This is the book's emotional philosophy in four lines. Do not change this.

**The opening note** does strong work setting expectations: this is real instruction wrapped in humor, it is for kids and adults, and stubbornness is the key ingredient. The line "it just happens to be written by someone who believes that learning does not have to be boring" is a clean thesis statement.

**One suggestion for the opening note:** The sentence "Parents, guardians, cool aunts, nervous grandparents" is warm and inclusive, but conspicuously omits uncles, older siblings, and non-family mentors (coaches, youth program leaders). Consider broadening slightly, or using a catch-all that doesn't risk making anyone feel excluded.

---

## Market Positioning

**Primary audience:** Children ages 7 to 12 who are interested in skateboarding, plus their parents/guardians.

**The dual-audience approach** (kids and parents together) is the book's strongest market differentiator. Most skateboarding instruction books target either kids or adults, not both simultaneously. The parent notes throughout, plus the dedicated parent chapter, make this a book a parent would buy with confidence.

**Potential market concern:** The reading level fluctuates. Some passages are clearly written for a child reading independently ("Your front foot goes on the board, angled forward, toes pointing roughly toward the nose"), while others are written at an adult level ("It builds balance, coordination, persistence, resilience, creativity, and problem-solving skills"). This is somewhat inevitable in a dual-audience book, but it should be acknowledged in marketing and positioning. This is a read-together book for younger kids and a read-alone book for older kids. Saying so explicitly (perhaps on the back cover or in the opening note) would help parents understand how to use it.

**Competitive positioning:** This book occupies a niche that is surprisingly underserved: funny, illustrated, safety-first beginner skateboarding for kids with built-in parent guidance. Most existing titles are either purely instructional (dry), purely aspirational (trick books with no beginner content), or not illustrated. This manuscript has a clear lane.

---

## Length

At 35 pages (including cover, dedication, and appendix), this is a lean manuscript. For an illustrated children's nonfiction book, the page count is appropriate if the illustrations are substantial. If the final product has roughly a 50/50 text-to-illustration ratio, the total page count after layout will likely land in the 48 to 64 page range, which is standard for this format.

**Sections that could be expanded:**
- Chapter 1 (equipment) could use a half-page on board sizing (mentioned above)
- A "Where to Skate" section would add one page
- Board maintenance would add a half-page

**Sections that could be tightened:**
- Chapter 9 (parents) overlaps significantly with the parent notes in other chapters. This chapter could either be cut and its unique content redistributed into the existing parent notes, or the existing parent notes could be trimmed and this chapter expanded to be the definitive parent resource. Currently it tries to be both, and neither version is as strong as it could be. My recommendation: keep Chapter 9 and make it the comprehensive parent section, then reduce the parent notes in other chapters to one or two sentences each, pointing parents to Chapter 9 for the full discussion.

---

## The Appendix

The first aid appendix is well-placed and well-written. It covers the right injuries in the right order of severity (head injuries first, then fractures, then sprains, then everyday scrapes). The inclusion of the updated PEACE & LOVE protocol instead of just RICE shows current medical awareness. The heat safety section is a smart addition.

**One concern:** The Appendix's file naming suggests it was split into two files: "32-appendix-first-aid-scrapessprains.md" and "33-appendix-first-aid-headfractures.md," but the content order is reversed: page 34 covers head injuries and fractures first, and page 35 covers sprains and scrapes. The filenames should match the content for production clarity.

**One addition to consider:** A brief note on when to call 911 versus going to urgent care versus waiting for a regular doctor visit. Parents, especially new-to-skateboarding parents, will appreciate this triage guidance.

---

## Parent Content vs. Kid Content

The balance is generally well-handled. The parent notes are clearly marked with blockquote formatting and the "A note for parents:" prefix. A child reading independently can skip them without losing anything.

**However:** Some parent-level content is embedded in the main text without being flagged as a parent note. For example:

- The price guidance in Chapter 1 ("A complete beginner skateboard from a real skate shop will run about $80 to $140") is written for parents but appears in the main text, not a parent note. A child does not need to know the price range.
- The "PEACE & LOVE" protocol in the Appendix is written at an adult comprehension level and uses medical terminology that kids may not follow. Consider flagging the Appendix as primarily a parent/guardian resource, or writing it in two layers: simple instructions for kids, detailed context for adults.

**The parent notes themselves** are consistently excellent. The note in Chapter 5 about turning ("Resist the urge to hover or grab them. If they fall, wait a beat") is particularly strong. The note in Chapter 7 about not saying "You're fine" is genuinely important parenting advice that goes beyond skateboarding.

## Publishability Assessment

**What is ready:**
- The voice and tone are publication-quality
- The instructional sequence is sound
- The safety content is accurate and thorough
- The emotional content (Chapter 7 especially) elevates this above a typical instructional book
- The poems are charming and well-integrated
- The illustration notes provide clear creative direction

**What needs work before publication:**

1. **Content gaps** outlined above (where to skate, board sizing, board maintenance, age guidance)
2. **Redundancy pass** to vary the language around repeated themes
3. **Chapter 9 decision:** consolidate parent content or expand the chapter and trim the notes
4. **Formatting cleanup:** remove `<br>` tags, fix the `~~` markup artifact on page 6
5. **Filename inconsistencies** in the appendix files
6. **Reading level audit:** decide on a target reading level and ensure the main text stays within it, pushing adult-level content into clearly marked parent sections
7. **Illustrations:** obviously, the book needs its illustrations. The illustration notes are strong creative direction, but until the art exists, this is half a book. The text-to-art balance will need to be evaluated once layouts begin.
8. **Back matter:** the book needs a brief "About the Author" section and, depending on the publisher, a bibliography or resources section (links to helmet certification guides, beginner skateboard buying guides, how to find a local skatepark)
9. **Legal review:** The first aid content should be reviewed by a medical professional and include a disclaimer that it does not substitute for professional medical advice. This is standard for any children's book containing health guidance.

## Factual Claims to Verify

1. **"Making humans fall down in spectacular fashion since the 1950s"** (Ch 1, page 4): The history of skateboarding's origins is debated, but 1950s is generally accepted. Verify the specific decade claim.

2. **"Tony Hawk wears a helmet. Andy Anderson wears a helmet."** (Ch 2, page 6): Both accurate as of this writing. Tony Hawk is well-documented. Andy Anderson is known for always wearing a helmet. However, these are living people and their practices could change or they could become controversial. Consider whether named endorsements are wise, or whether a more general "the best professionals in the world" framing is safer long-term.

3. **"ASTM F1492 standard"** (Ch 2, page 7): This is the correct skateboarding helmet standard. Verify it has not been superseded or updated.

4. **"Alan 'Ollie' Gelfand, actually stumbled onto it by accident in the late 1970s while skating a poorly built pool in Florida"** (Ch 6, page 22): The attribution to Gelfand is correct. The "poorly built pool" detail and the "by accident" characterization should be verified against reliable sources. The Gelfand ollie was in a bowl/pool context, but the specific "poorly built" detail may be apocryphal. "Rodney Mullen later figured out how to do it on flat ground" is accurate.

5. **"$80 to $140"** for a beginner complete skateboard (Ch 1, page 4): Verify this is current. Prices fluctuate. Consider whether to give a range at all, or simply say "expect to invest in a quality complete from a real skate shop" and let the shop advise.

6. **"PEACE & LOVE" protocol** (Appendix, page 35): This is the current evidence-based recommendation replacing RICE, published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine. The summary in the book is accurate. Worth having a medical reviewer confirm the book's description is complete and correctly stated.

## Specific Line-Level Issues

**Page 3 (Opening Note):**
"Parents, guardians, cool aunts, nervous grandparents" — The em dash after "grandparents" in the original appears to have been replaced with a comma, which is correct per the style guide. However, the list could be slightly more inclusive as noted above.

**Page 5 (Ch 1, parts):**
"The front end is called the nose and the back end is called the tail." — This information appears at the end of the DECK paragraph. Consider whether it deserves its own bolded callout, since nose and tail are referenced repeatedly throughout the book. A child who skims may miss this buried in a paragraph about ply count.

**Page 6 (Ch 2, opener):**
"~~ Here's what IS cool: being able to skateboard again tomorrow because you were smart today." — The `~~` is a formatting artifact that needs to be removed. The line itself is strong.

**Page 7 (Ch 2, helmet):**
"(If you shake your head vigorously and it doesn't move but you get dizzy, you may have shaken too vigorously.)" — Funny, but consider whether a child might actually shake their head too hard trying to test a helmet. The joke lands, but it could prompt the behavior it jokes about. A small risk, but worth flagging.

**Page 11 (Ch 3, Step 2):**
"Imagine you are a very relaxed, slightly crouching person who is totally in control. Because you are." — The "Because you are" is doing important confidence-building work. Good line.

**Page 14 (Ch 4, Rule 4):**
"On a smooth surface (a garage, a basketball court, a kitchen floor if your parents are out and the floor is clean)" — The "if your parents are out" is funny but could be read as encouraging kids to do something without parental supervision. Consider changing to "a kitchen floor if your parents say it's okay" to keep the joke while adding the permission layer.

**Page 17 (Ch 5, pushing):**
"Avoid anywhere a car might appear. (Cars always win in a fight with skateboards. Always.)" — Strong safety message, good humor. No change needed.

**Page 18 (Ch 5, stopping):**
"Like you're trying to flatten a very persistent bug." — Depending on your target audience's sensitivity, this simile might land differently. Most kids will find it funny. Flagging it only because some editors in the children's space would raise it.

**Page 22 (Ch 6, Week 9+):**
"But that's another chapter for another day. (Or another book.)" — This is a natural place to mention that the ollie is beyond this book's scope, which the author does well. However, it also creates a slight disappointment for the reader who has been building toward this moment for 22 pages. Consider adding one more sentence of encouragement: something that validates the reader's readiness without leaving them hanging.

**Page 24 (Ch 7, rest vs. ride):**
"RIDE if: It's a bruise. It's road rash (clean it first!). It's sore muscles. It's wounded pride." — This is clean, practical, and well-structured. The "wounded pride" inclusion is a nice touch that normalizes emotional recovery alongside physical.

**Page 29 (Ch 8, Rule 4):**
"But do go during off-peak hours at first, early mornings and weekdays are usually quieter." — This is a comma splice. Should be: "But do go during off-peak hours at first. Early mornings and weekdays are usually quieter." Or use a semicolon.

**Appendix, page 34:**
"A damaged helmet is decoration, not protection." — Excellent line. Memorable, quotable, exactly the kind of thing a parent will repeat.

**Appendix, page 35:**
"This is your body's color wheel. It is healing." — Another strong line. The author has a gift for making medical information feel reassuring rather than clinical.

## Summary of Recommendations, Prioritized

**High priority (must address before publication):**
1. Add age range guidance
2. Add board sizing information
3. Add "where to skate" content
4. Clean up formatting artifacts (`<br>` tags, `~~` markup)
5. Have first aid content reviewed by a medical professional
6. Add medical disclaimer
7. Resolve the Chapter 9 / parent notes redundancy
8. Fix the comma splice on page 29

**Medium priority (should address):**
1. Add board maintenance basics
2. Vary the "you will fall" language across chapters
3. Match helmet certification language between Chapter 2 and Appendix
4. Add weather/surface condition guidance
5. Expand the opening note's inclusive language for caregivers
6. Consider reading level consistency in main text vs. parent content
7. Verify all factual claims (see list above)
8. Fix appendix file naming

**Low priority (consider addressing):**
1. Rethink Chapter 6's title for more personality
2. Reconsider Chapter 9's "very brief" self-description
3. Add About the Author section
4. Add resources/further reading section
5. Consider the "kitchen floor if your parents are out" line
6. Add one more sentence after the ollie tease in Chapter 6

## Final Thoughts

This is a manuscript with a clear, distinctive voice, accurate instructional content, and genuine emotional depth. It knows exactly what it is, and what it is happens to fill a real gap in the children's nonfiction market. The author understands both skateboarding and children, which is a rarer combination than it should be.

The issues identified above are all fixable and none of them are structural. The bones of this book are strong. With one focused revision pass addressing the high-priority items, a medical review of the appendix, and the illustrations, this is a publishable book.

I would recommend this manuscript move forward in our pipeline.
