## Voice and Tone

This is the book's greatest strength, and it is considerable. The voice is warm, self-aware, conversational, and genuinely funny without ever being condescending. It reads like a smart, kind adult talking directly to a kid who they actually respect, which is shockingly rare in children's instructional books.

The tone walks an extremely difficult line: it is silly enough to keep kids laughing and serious enough to keep parents trusting. I have seen hundreds of manuscripts attempt this balance and most fail on one side or the other. This one nails it.

A few specific moments where the voice is at its best:

- "A toddler could describe it. And yet this simple piece of wood with four wheels has been making humans fall down in spectacular fashion since the 1950s." (Chapter 1 opener) Perfect. Clean joke, real information, no wasted words.
- "This is not a threat, it is a physics-based prediction." (Chapter 2, wrist guards) This is the book's signature move: delivering genuinely important safety info inside a joke. It works every time.
- "If you shake your head vigorously and it doesn't move but you get dizzy, you may have shaken too vigorously." (Chapter 2, helmet fitting) This kind of deadpan aside is exactly what kids love. It rewards them for paying attention to the safety details.

The voice is remarkably consistent across the full manuscript. I did not find any sections where the author lost the thread or shifted into a different register accidentally. That kind of consistency across 35 pages is an achievement.

One very minor observation: the phrase "Here's the thing" appears at the beginning of paragraphs in several chapters (Chapter 2 safety gear opener, Chapter 5 first ride, Chapter 6 practice plan, Chapter 7 hard parts). It is a natural speech pattern and not a problem in isolation, but across the full read it starts to register as a verbal tic. I would vary the construction in two or three of those instances, keeping the one where it lands hardest (Chapter 7, "The hard part is the feeling," where the setup genuinely earns its weight).

## Character Use

The forest critters (Baby Skate Bunny, Squirrel, Kitty, Turtle, Duck, Jay) are used smartly as illustration subjects rather than narrative characters, which is the right call for this format. They do not talk, they do not have subplots, and they do not distract from the instructional content. Instead, they serve as visual proxies for the reader's experience: Kitty is nervous, Duck is confused, Turtle is slow but steady, Squirrel is eager.

This is a well-established technique in children's instructional books (think of the DK "Eyewitness" mascot characters, or the creatures in "Diary of a Wombat" style illustration) and it works here because the author resists the temptation to give them too much personality in the text. They live in the illustration notes and that is their correct home.

Turtle in particular is doing quiet comic work throughout the manuscript. "Turtle looks especially confident about the 'be a ball' part, naturally round" (Chapter 4) is a perfect example of an illustration note that adds humor without interrupting the instruction.

One suggestion: Baby Skate Bunny is clearly the leader/expert, but the manuscript never gives the other critters individual moments of triumph. Consider one illustration note, perhaps in the practice plan chapters (Weeks 3-4 or 5-8), where one of the other critters lands something specific. Kitty finally looking confident, or Duck managing a turn without flapping. It would reinforce the "progress is personal" message and give the illustrator a chance to show growth in the supporting cast.

## Pacing

The pacing is strong overall. The book moves through a logical progression: what the thing is, how to protect yourself, how to stand on it, how to fall off it, how to ride it, how to practice, how to cope emotionally, how to behave in public, how parents should support it, and how to close the journey. This is sound instructional sequencing.

Chapters 1-5 move at a near-perfect pace. Each section introduces one concept, develops it clearly, adds humor, and moves on. A kid reading this book (or having it read to them) would not get bored and would not feel overwhelmed.

**Chapter 6 (Practice Plan)** is the one section where the pacing dips slightly. The week-by-week breakdown is useful and necessary, but the bullet-point format across three pages reads more like a handout than a book. The writing voice that makes the rest of the manuscript so engaging is largely absent from these lists. The opening paragraph of Chapter 6 is great ("Fifteen minutes a day beats two hours once a week"), but then the chapter becomes a checklist.

I am not suggesting the practice plan be removed, because it is genuinely valuable. But consider whether the bullet points could be broken up with a brief narrative beat between weeks: a one-sentence check-in with the reader, a joke, a reassurance. Something like the voice that opens Chapter 5 ("Okay. You've practiced standing. You've practiced falling. You know the parts of your board.") to bridge between the list sections. The reader needs to feel the author is still with them, not just handing them a worksheet.

**Chapter 9 (For Parents)** runs the opposite risk: it is excellent writing but it comes late in the book and shifts the audience explicitly to adults. A child reading the book cover-to-cover will hit this chapter and feel momentarily sidelined. The parent notes embedded throughout the earlier chapters are a better delivery mechanism because they do not interrupt the child's reading flow (they are clearly marked as asides). Consider whether Chapter 9 could be repositioned as a preface or appendix rather than a full chapter in the main sequence. The content is too good to cut, but its placement breaks the child reader's momentum right before the finale.

## The Poems

There are five poems in the manuscript (Chapter 2 closing, Chapter 4 closing, Chapter 7 closing, Chapter 9 closing, and the finale). They serve as emotional punctuation marks at the end of major sections, and this structural choice is sound.

**The strongest poem** is the finale (Chapter 10, page 33): "A board beneath your feet, my dear / The whole wide world ahead." This is genuinely good children's verse. It has rhythm, it has warmth, it has a rising emotional trajectory, and "However wobbly, you belong" is a line that will make parents cry in the bookstore. It earns its length and its placement as the capstone of the book.

**The second strongest** is the Chapter 7 poem: "You fell. / I saw. / That looked like it hurt quite a lot." The brevity here is powerful. It mirrors the emotional directness of the chapter it closes. Five lines, no filler.

**The Chapter 2 poem** (safety gear) is functional but slightly flat: "A helmet on your head, my dear, / and knee pads on your knees." It reads more like a mnemonic than a poem. It does its job (reinforcing gear as normal and expected) but it does not land with the same emotional weight as the others. Given that this is the first poem in the book and sets the reader's expectations for what poems will do in this manuscript, it might benefit from one more beat of warmth or humor. A third couplet, perhaps, that echoes the chapter's "your brain is you" message.

**The Chapter 9 poem** (parents) is effective: "But look at their face. / LOOK at their face." The caps on "LOOK" are a strong choice and they work on the page. However, the rhyme of "time" with "dime" in the closing couplet is the weakest rhyme in the manuscript. "That joy is worth every dime" slightly cheapens the sentiment by introducing a money metaphor into what is otherwise a purely emotional moment. I would look for an alternative that stays in the emotional register: something about worth, value, or the ache of watching your kid be brave, without the commercial connotation.

## Opening Hook

The cover text is excellent. "How hard can it be? (Very. The answer is very.)" is a perfect hook for both kids and adults. It is self-deprecating, honest, and immediately establishes the book's comedic voice.

The dedication is quietly brilliant. "For everyone who fell down and sat there for a while. That's okay too." This is doing emotional work before the book has even started. It tells the reader: this book sees you, it will not judge you, and it will meet you where you are. For an anxious kid picking up a skateboarding book, this is a gift.

"A Note Before We Begin" functions as the true opening, and it works. The direct address ("Please actually read this part"), the establishment of credibility ("based on real skateboarding instruction"), and the landing on "It's stubbornness" are all strong moves. "And maybe this book. Let's begin." is a clean, confident transition into the content.

I would not change the opening sequence. It is doing exactly what it needs to do.

## Emotional Arc

This is where the book distinguishes itself from every other children's skateboarding book on the market. It has a genuine emotional arc, which is remarkable for an instructional guide.

The arc moves from curiosity (Chapters 1-2) to tentative courage (Chapters 3-5) to structured growth (Chapter 6) to emotional reckoning (Chapter 7) to community belonging (Chapter 8) to release and celebration (Chapter 10). Chapter 7 is the emotional center of the book, and the author clearly knows this. "The hard part of skateboarding is not the skateboarding. The hard part is the feeling." is the thesis of the entire manuscript stated plainly.

The illustration note on page 23 (Squirrel sitting with a scraped knee, Baby Skate Bunny just being there, "not fixing anything, just being there, shoulders touching") is described in the note as "the emotional heart of the book," and that self-awareness is earned. This is a powerful image that communicates something true about friendship, support, and resilience without a single word of instruction.

The progression from "How to Fall" (physical) to "The Hard Parts" (emotional) is structurally smart. The reader has already learned that falling is a skill, so when the book says "the hard part is the feeling," the reader has been primed to understand: if falling can be learned, maybe coping can be learned too.

**One note on the arc:** the transition from Chapter 8 (Skatepark Etiquette) to Chapter 9 (For Parents) to Chapter 10 (The End) feels slightly bumpy. Chapter 8 is practical and community-focused, Chapter 9 pivots to a different audience entirely, and then Chapter 10 is a soaring emotional conclusion. The reader goes from "don't sit on obstacles" to "let them fail" to "you're doing this!" in three chapters, and the emotional register is jolting. As mentioned above, moving the parent chapter to a different position (preface or appendix) would smooth this final stretch considerably and let the book build uninterrupted from "you belong at the park" to "you belong on this board" to "however wobbly, you belong."

## Age-Appropriate Humor

The humor works across the full target range (6-12) and, critically, it also works for the adults who will be reading aloud. This is the gold standard for children's humor: layered enough that the parent laughing is laughing at a different layer than the kid laughing.

Jokes that will land for younger kids (6-8):
- Turtle sniffing the nose of the skateboard because it is called the nose
- Duck trying to figure out wrist guards with wings
- "Be a ball, not a stick" (physical, visual, immediately graspable)
- Hardware bolts disappearing into carpet (every kid has lost a small thing)

Jokes that will land for older kids (9-12):
- "This is not a threat, it is a physics-based prediction"
- "It is a whole economy" (grip tape and shoe destruction)
- "Your body's color wheel" (bruise colors in the appendix)
- The entire concept of a "villain origin story" for rain

Jokes that will land for adults:
- "Imagine a hippo on a halfpipe right here"
- "A one-hit wonder" (helmet replacement)
- "on a kitchen floor if your parents are out and the floor is clean"
- "Ice cream? (Ice cream is almost always appropriate.)"

I did not find any jokes that felt forced, mean-spirited, or likely to confuse the audience. The humor consistently serves the instruction rather than competing with it.

## The Closing

The closing is outstanding. Chapter 10 earns its emotional payoff because the book has done the work to get there.

The prose section (page 32) uses a deliberate structural echo of the book's content, building from "You know the parts of a skateboard" through each skill until arriving at "You know how to be scared and do it anyway, or be scared and wait until you're ready." This is effective rhetoric: it reminds the reader of everything they have learned and reframes it as a cumulative achievement.

"And you push." as the final sentence of the prose section is a perfect ending. Short, active, forward-moving, and it echoes the physical act that begins every skateboarding session.

The final poem ("However wobbly, you belong") is the strongest piece of writing in the manuscript. It is the line that will end up on merchandise, in reviews, and in the minds of readers long after they finish the book. It captures the entire emotional thesis in four words.

"THE END (Now go skateboard.)" is the right final beat. It is funny, confident, and it literally pushes the reader out the door. No lingering, no sentiment after the sentiment. Just go.

## Tonal Inconsistencies

There are very few, which is notable for a manuscript of this length.

**The appendix** shifts into a noticeably more clinical tone, which is appropriate for first aid content but feels slightly abrupt after the emotional high of Chapter 10. Consider adding a one-sentence transitional note at the top of the appendix that acknowledges the tonal shift: something brief that says "Okay, serious hat on for a minute" in the book's voice, before diving into the medical information. The line "Because you're going to need this page. Keep it bookmarked." is already doing some of this work, but it could do a touch more to bridge from the finale's warmth.

**The parent notes** are consistently well-written but their tone varies slightly. Some are warm and reassuring ("This is a great time to just be present and encouraging") while others are slightly more directive ("Please, please, please do not make safety gear a negotiation"). Both registers are fine individually, but the "please, please, please" note has a faint edge of exasperation that is slightly different from the rest. It is a small thing.

There are no moments where the book becomes preachy or lectures the reader. The closest it comes is the comparison passage in Chapter 7 ("Comparison is a thief. Progress is personal.") but even there, the italicized formatting and the surrounding context frame it as an earned emotional truth rather than a lecture. The author has clearly been careful about this.

## Illustration Notes

The illustration notes are excellent creative direction. They are specific enough to guide an illustrator but loose enough to allow artistic interpretation. They describe compositions, emotional beats, and visual gags with clarity.

Standout illustration notes:

- **Page 23 (Squirrel and Bunny sitting together):** "Not fixing anything, just being there. Shoulders touching." This is the kind of emotional specificity that produces great illustration. An illustrator reading this will know exactly what feeling to capture.
- **Page 32 (the final ride):** "All at different skill levels, Squirrel confident, Kitty a little wobbly, Duck flapping for balance, Turtle slow but steady, Jay gliding." This is smart because it visually reinforces the "progress is personal" message without saying it again in words.
- **Page 14 (knee slide):** "Dust clouds behind her. Knee pads gleaming." The word "gleaming" is doing real work here, making the safety gear look cool and aspirational.

One note: some of the illustration descriptions are quite long and detailed (page 5's Turtle description, page 9's full-cast gear scene). For production purposes, consider marking which visual elements are essential versus which are nice-to-have. An illustrator will appreciate knowing which details are load-bearing and which are suggestions.

The illustration notes consistently match the emotional tone of the text they accompany. Instructional pages get clear, diagram-style notes. Emotional pages get warm, character-driven notes. Poem pages get atmospheric, mood-focused notes. This is thoughtful art direction.

## Specific Suggestions

**1. Chapter 6, Practice Plan (pages 20-22):** Inject brief narrative beats between the weekly bullet lists. Even a single sentence per transition ("Still here? Good. Let's keep going." or a quick joke about how Week 3 is where your shoes start looking tragic) would maintain the book's voice through the most list-heavy section.

**2. Chapter 9, For Parents (pages 30-31):** Strongly consider repositioning this as a preface ("A Note for Grown-Ups Before We Begin") or as a second appendix after the first aid section. The content is excellent, but its placement as Chapter 9 interrupts the child reader's journey from community belonging (Chapter 8) to emotional conclusion (Chapter 10).

**3. Chapter 2 poem (page 9):** Consider expanding by one couplet to give it more emotional weight as the book's first poem. As it stands, it is the weakest of the five poems and it sets the bar for what poems do in this book. It does not need to be long, but it could use one more breath.

**4. Chapter 9 poem (page 31):** Replace "dime" with a rhyme that stays in the emotional register rather than introducing a monetary metaphor. "That joy is worth every dime" slightly undercuts the preceding "LOOK at their face" moment.

**5. Recurring "Here's the thing" openings:** Vary three of the four instances. Keep the one in Chapter 7, where the construction carries the most weight.

**6. Appendix transition (page 34):** Add one more sentence in the book's voice before the clinical content begins. The reader just experienced the emotional peak of the finale and needs a slightly softer landing into first aid territory.

**7. Character growth beat:** Add one illustration note somewhere in Chapters 6-8 that shows a specific critter achieving something they were struggling with earlier. This would visually complete the "everyone progresses at their own pace" arc.

## Overall Assessment

This is a very good children's book. It is genuinely instructional, genuinely funny, and genuinely moving, which is a combination that very few manuscripts achieve. The voice is distinctive, consistent, and respectful of its audience. The emotional arc is real and earned. The safety information is accurate and delivered without being boring or preachy. The illustration notes are thoughtful creative direction that will serve an illustrator well.

The structural suggestions above (repositioning the parent chapter, smoothing the practice plan pacing, strengthening the first poem) are refinements, not rescues. The manuscript is strong as it stands.

The closing line, "However wobbly, you belong," is the kind of sentence that defines a book. It is honest, inclusive, and emotionally true. It will resonate with kids learning to skate, parents watching them fall, and, frankly, anyone who has ever tried something hard and felt uncertain about whether they had the right to be there.

This book has a clear place in the market. It fills a gap between the overly technical skateboarding manuals (which are useful but joyless) and the novelty picture books about skateboarding (which are fun but teach nothing). It does both, and it does both well.

I would recommend this for publication with the minor structural revisions noted above.
