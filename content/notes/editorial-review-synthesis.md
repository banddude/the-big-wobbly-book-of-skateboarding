## Tier 1: Safety Fixes (Must Fix Before Publication)

### 1. Step-off stopping technique could cause injury as written

**Issue:** The stopping section describes stepping "off the front of the board," which at speed can cause the board to shoot backward into bystanders or catch the rider's foot. Stepping off backward is also dangerous (board rockets forward, rider falls back).

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder (#1 priority), Coach (explicitly warns against stepping off backward)

**Fix:** Rewrite to specify stepping off to the side, or leading with the back foot then front foot. Add a warning: "Always step off toward the front, the direction you are already moving. Never step off the back." The Coach also suggests reordering the three stopping methods: step-off first (most natural for beginners), foot brake second, tail scrape third.

---

### 2. Tuck and roll / shoulder roll lacks sufficient detail for safety-critical content

**Issue:** The shoulder roll instruction ("fall forward and roll over your shoulder, like a somersault but starting from the side") is a single sentence describing a complex movement. It does not repeat the chin tuck instruction from earlier in the chapter, and it does not specify which shoulder or how to protect the head during the roll. For younger kids (under 8), the shoulder roll can cause neck injuries if done wrong.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder (wants chin tuck bolded/emphasized more), Teacher (wants "chin tucked" repeated in the practice steps), Coach (wants age caveat for younger kids)

**Fix:** (a) Repeat "chin tucked" explicitly in the tuck-and-roll practice drill. (b) Add more detail about how to execute the roll safely. (c) Add a note for younger skaters (under 8) to focus on the squat-and-sit fall and knee slide instead, per the Coach's recommendation.

**Files:** `content/12-ch-4-how-to-fall-rules-1-2.md` (Rule 2 chin tuck emphasis), `content/14-ch-4-how-to-fall-rule-5-practice.md` (practice drill detail)

---

### 3. No "skate with a buddy" safety message

**Issue:** The book never explicitly says kids should skate with a friend or have an adult nearby, especially while learning. If a child falls and hits their head or breaks a wrist, they need someone who can get help.

**Flagged by:** Coach, Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Add a brief note in the safety chapter or first ride chapter: "Always skate with a friend or have a grown-up nearby, especially while you are learning. If something goes wrong, you want someone there who can help."

**File:** `content/05-ch-2-safety-gear-opener.md` or `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md`

---

### 4. Surface hazard warnings are missing

**Issue:** The book says "find a smooth, flat surface" but does not warn about specific hazards: wet surfaces, sand/gravel on pavement, painted lines, metal grates, pebbles, or debris. A small pebble can lock a front wheel and send a beginner flying. Wet metal is especially dangerous.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder, Coach, Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Add a "surfaces to watch out for" note. The Coach suggests: "Before you start, walk the area and clear away any pebbles, sticks, or debris. A tiny rock can stop a wheel dead and send you forward fast." The Skateboarder adds wet surfaces, sand/gravel, painted lines, and metal grates. This could slot into the first ride chapter.

**File:** `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md`

---

### 5. First aid appendix needs medical disclaimer and professional review

**Issue:** The book contains specific medical guidance (PEACE & LOVE protocol, head injury protocol, anti-inflammatory advice). This needs a disclaimer that it does not substitute for professional medical advice, and should be reviewed by a medical professional before publication. This is standard for any children's book containing health guidance.

**Flagged by:** Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Add a disclaimer line at the top of the appendix. Have the full appendix reviewed by a medical professional.

**Files:** `content/32-appendix-first-aid-scrapessprains.md`, `content/33-appendix-first-aid-headfractures.md`

---

### 6. Kitchen floor joke could encourage unsupervised practice

**Issue:** The line "a kitchen floor if your parents are out and the floor is clean" is funny but could be read as encouraging kids to practice without parental supervision.

**Flagged by:** Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Change to "a kitchen floor if your parents say it's okay and the floor is clean." Keeps the joke, adds the permission layer.

**File:** `content/14-ch-4-how-to-fall-rule-5-practice.md`

---

## Tier 2: High Priority (Multiple Reviewers Flagged)

### 7. "Weight forward over cracks" needs clarification

**Issue:** The practice plan says "weight forward, knees bent" for riding over cracks and bumps. This is the only mention of weight distribution for obstacles in the entire book, and it is ambiguous. "Weight forward" could be misread as "lean your whole body forward," which would pitch the rider over the front. It should mean "slightly toward the front foot." Also, the pebble scenario is different, where you actually want weight slightly back.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder, Teacher

**Fix:** Clarify "weight forward" to "shift your weight slightly toward your front foot." Consider adding 2-3 sentences about obstacle riding in Chapter 5 rather than introducing this technique only as a parenthetical in the practice plan.

**File:** `content/20-ch-6-practice-plan-week-3-8.md`, and consider adding content to `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md`

---

### 8. Turning section is incomplete

**Issue:** The turning description says "lean your toes / lean your heels" but: (a) does not clarify which direction the board actually goes when you lean each way, (b) could be taken literally as "lean the toes themselves" rather than "shift weight toward the toe side," and (c) does not mention the most effective turning tip: look where you want to go.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder (direction clarification), Teacher ("lean toward your toes" wording), Coach ("look where you want to go" is the #1 instructional addition)

**Fix:** (a) Add "the board turns toward where your toes point." (b) Change "lean your toes" to "lean toward your toes" or "press down on your toe side." (c) Add the Coach's suggested sentence: "Here is the secret to turning: look where you want to go. Turn your head first, your shoulders will follow, and the board will follow your shoulders."

**File:** `content/18-ch-5-your-first-ride-turning.md`

---

### 9. Pushing instructions need numbered sub-steps and foot placement detail

**Issue:** The pushing sequence describes three actions in one sentence ("put your back foot on the tail, rotate your front foot sideways, and ride"), which is hard for a child to follow while standing at their board. Also, the text does not specify where on the deck the front foot should be during the push (just behind front bolts, centered on width).

**Flagged by:** Teacher (numbered sub-steps), Coach (foot placement detail)

**Fix:** Break the pushing instructions into numbered sub-steps (1. Push with back foot, 2. Place back foot on tail, 3. Rotate front foot sideways, 4. Bend knees and ride). Add: "Center your front foot over the board, just behind the front bolts."

**File:** `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md`

---

### 10. Chapter 9 (parents) placement breaks the reading flow

**Issue:** Chapter 9 shifts the audience to adults right between the community chapter (Ch 8) and the emotional finale (Ch 10). A child reading cover-to-cover feels sidelined. The chapter also overlaps significantly with parent notes already distributed throughout the book.

**Flagged by:** Children's Author (strongly recommends repositioning as preface or second appendix), Editor-in-Chief (calls out redundancy, suggests either expanding Ch 9 and trimming inline notes, or cutting Ch 9 and redistributing)

**Fix:** Two options: (a) Move Chapter 9 to a preface ("A Note for Grown-Ups Before We Begin") or a second appendix after first aid. (b) Keep Chapter 9 but make it the comprehensive parent section, then trim inline parent notes to 1-2 sentences each with a pointer to Ch 9. Either way, the transition from Ch 8 to Ch 10 needs to flow without interruption.

**Files:** `content/28-ch-9-for-parents-support.md`, `content/29-ch-9-for-parents-pace-poem.md`

---

### 11. Mongo pushing needs a normalizing sentence to prevent shame

**Issue:** The mongo pushing callout is accurate but a child who has already been pushing mongo may feel embarrassed. The term itself has mocking connotations in skate culture.

**Flagged by:** Psychologist, Coach (wants a brief "why" explanation added)

**Fix:** Add: "If you've been pushing mongo, no big deal, lots of people start that way. Just start practicing with your back foot and it'll feel natural soon." Also add the Coach's "why": "because your weight ends up on the wrong foot and you have to shuffle both feet into position before you can turn or stop."

**File:** `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md`

---

### 12. Undefined skate vocabulary terms

**Issue:** Several skate-specific terms are used without definition: "bail/bail out" (p.14), "line" (p.28), "dropping in" (p.25), "bowl" (p.14 and p.28). The book handles other terms well with inline definitions, but these are inconsistent.

**Flagged by:** Teacher (all four terms), Editor-in-Chief (mentions "line" context)

**Fix:** Add brief parenthetical definitions on first use:
- "bail out (step away from a trick before you crash)"
- "line (the path they're skating)"
- "dropping in (rolling into a ramp from the top)"
- "bowl (a large, rounded concrete basin, like an empty swimming pool)"

**Files:** `content/14-ch-4-how-to-fall-rule-5-practice.md` (bail), `content/24-ch-7-hard-parts-fear.md` (dropping in), `content/26-ch-8-skatepark-etiquette-rules-1-3.md` or `content/27-ch-8-skatepark-etiquette-rules-4-6.md` (line, bowl)

---

### 13. Price range for beginner board needs updating

**Issue:** The book says "$80-$140" for a complete from a skate shop. In 2025/2026, this is low. More realistic is $90-$160 or $100-$150.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder, Editor-in-Chief (suggests considering whether to give a specific range at all)

**Fix:** Either update the range to "$100-$150" or shift to more general language like "expect to invest in a quality complete from a real skate shop, ask the staff to help you pick the right one."

**File:** `content/04-ch-1-the-skateboard-parts.md`

---

### 14. No age range guidance

**Issue:** The book says it is "for kids" but never specifies a recommended starting age. Parents will want to know.

**Flagged by:** Coach (wants age-adjusted timelines for younger skaters), Editor-in-Chief (calls this a must-address item)

**Fix:** Add recommended age range (roughly 7-12) in the opening note or parent chapter. The Coach also suggests adding a note in the practice plan: "Younger skaters (under 8) might need twice as long for each phase. That is fine. You are not behind."

**Files:** `content/02-a-note-before-we-begin.md`, `content/19-ch-6-practice-plan-week-1-2.md`

---

### 15. Formatting artifacts need cleanup

**Issue:** `<br>` tags in the Chapter 2 opener and `~~` markup on page 6 are rendering artifacts that need to be removed before print.

**Flagged by:** Editor-in-Chief (flags both as high priority)

**Fix:** Remove all `<br>` tags and `~~` markup artifacts.

**File:** `content/05-ch-2-safety-gear-opener.md`

---

### 16. Helmet certification language inconsistency

**Issue:** Chapter 2 gives the full "ASTM F1492 and CPSC" certification, but the Appendix just says "CPSC and ASTM" without the specific F1492 number. These should match.

**Flagged by:** Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Use "ASTM F1492 and CPSC" consistently in both locations.

**Files:** `content/06-ch-2-safety-gear-helmet-wrists.md`, `content/33-appendix-first-aid-headfractures.md`

---

## Tier 3: Strong Single-Reviewer Suggestions

### 17. "Terrible instinct" language could increase body distrust in anxious kids

**Issue:** The wrist guard section says "your instinct will be to catch yourself with your hands. This is a terrible instinct, but it is a very powerful one." The word "terrible" frames the child's automatic body response as bad, which can increase body distrust in anxious children.

**Flagged by:** Psychologist

**Fix:** Change to: "This instinct is very strong, but it's not the safest one." Same information, removes the judgment of the child's body.

**File:** `content/06-ch-2-safety-gear-helmet-wrists.md`

---

### 18. Name frustration explicitly in the defeat/struggle section

**Issue:** Chapter 7 addresses comparison and slow progress but does not name "frustration" as a specific feeling. Kids often cannot distinguish between "I'm frustrated" and "I can't do this." Naming the feeling gives them vocabulary to process it.

**Flagged by:** Psychologist, Teacher (suggests a cross-reference to Ch 7 emotional content from Ch 5)

**Fix:** Add 2-3 sentences: "That hot, angry feeling when you try something ten times and it still doesn't work? That's frustration. And frustration means your brain is working on the problem. It doesn't feel good, but it's actually a sign that you're learning."

**File:** `content/23-ch-7-hard-parts-rest-defeat.md`

---

### 19. Add "leaning back when scared" as a common mistake

**Issue:** The most common beginner fall pattern is leaning back when nervous, which shifts weight off the front truck, makes the board squirrely, and causes it to shoot forward while the rider falls backward. The book does not mention this.

**Flagged by:** Coach

**Fix:** Add to the common mistakes section: "When you feel nervous, your instinct is to lean back. Fight that instinct. Keep your weight centered or slightly forward. Leaning back is what makes the board shoot out from under you."

**File:** `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md` or `content/17-ch-5-your-first-ride-stopping.md`

---

### 20. Truck tightness clarification

**Issue:** The book advises beginners to keep trucks tighter, but does not warn against over-tightening. Parents sometimes crank trucks so tight they cannot turn, which is more dangerous because the kid cannot steer.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder

**Fix:** Add: "Tighter, but still able to turn when you lean. If you crank them down so they do not turn at all, you will not be able to steer around things."

**File:** `content/04-ch-1-the-skateboard-parts.md`

---

### 21. Pre-ride board check

**Issue:** No mention of checking the board before riding. Spin wheels, wiggle trucks, check hardware for loose bolts. Takes ten seconds, prevents "my wheel fell off while riding" scenarios.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder

**Fix:** Add a quick pre-ride checklist before the first ride: "Before you ride, do a quick check: spin each wheel (are they all spinning freely?), wiggle the trucks (solidly attached?), check the bolts (none loose?). Ten seconds now saves a crash later."

**File:** `content/10-ch-3-before-you-roll-board-1-2.md` or `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md`

---

### 22. Headphones at the skatepark

**Issue:** Kids skating with earbuds cannot hear someone calling "dropping!" or approaching from behind. This is both a safety and etiquette issue.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder

**Fix:** Add: "Keep your ears open at the park. Save the headphones for solo cruising."

**File:** `content/27-ch-8-skatepark-etiquette-rules-4-6.md`

---

### 23. Add "where to skate" content

**Issue:** The book says "find a smooth, flat surface" and discusses skateparks, but has no dedicated discussion of where beginners should and should not skate: driveways, empty parking lots, tennis courts, and where NOT to skate (streets, steep hills).

**Flagged by:** Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Add a short "where to skate" section. Could fit as an early part of Chapter 5 or a brief addition to Chapter 3. The Coach's suggestion to "set your board down and see if it rolls on its own, if it does, you are on a slope, find flatter ground" is a practical addition here.

**File:** `content/16-ch-5-your-first-ride-pushing.md` (or new section)

---

### 24. Board sizing information

**Issue:** The book mentions price but not how to size a board to the rider. Deck width relative to shoe size/rider height is one of the first questions a parent will have.

**Flagged by:** Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Add at minimum: "Ask the shop to help size the deck to your kid." A brief note about width relative to shoe size would be even better.

**File:** `content/04-ch-1-the-skateboard-parts.md`

---

### 25. Fearless kids need self-assessment help, not just gear

**Issue:** The parent chapter says "don't hold back the fearless kid (just make sure they're geared up)" but fearless kids also need help learning to pause and evaluate. Impulsivity is not courage.

**Flagged by:** Psychologist

**Fix:** Add: "The fearless kid might need gentle help learning to stop and think, 'Am I ready for this?' before charging ahead. This is not discouragement. It is teaching them to think like a skilled skater."

**File:** `content/28-ch-9-for-parents-support.md`

---

### 26. Wrist guard explanation is dense for younger readers

**Issue:** The sentence about rigid splints distributing impact across the forearm is accurate but dense. The physics explanation later in the book ("the impact gets spread across a larger area and a longer time") handles the same concept more accessibly.

**Flagged by:** Teacher

**Fix:** Add a brief analogy: "Instead of all the force hitting one small spot, it spreads out over a bigger area, like how snowshoes keep you from sinking."

**File:** `content/06-ch-2-safety-gear-helmet-wrists.md`

---

### 27. PEACE & LOVE acronym not fully spelled out

**Issue:** The appendix covers the PEACE portion but does not identify or fully spell out the LOVE portion (Load, Optimism, Vascularization, Exercise).

**Flagged by:** Teacher, Editor-in-Chief (partially)

**Fix:** Spell out both halves of the acronym completely.

**File:** `content/32-appendix-first-aid-scrapessprains.md`

---

### 28. Anti-inflammatory advice needs plain language

**Issue:** "Avoid anti-inflammatories for the first day or two" is evidence-based but parents may not know this means ibuprofen. Could cause confusion.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder

**Fix:** Add parenthetical: "(this means ibuprofen and similar medicines, check with your doctor)."

**File:** `content/32-appendix-first-aid-scrapessprains.md`

---

### 29. Add tooth injury guidance to appendix

**Issue:** Face-plants happen. Dental injuries from skateboarding are more common than people think.

**Flagged by:** Skateboarder (suggests mouth guards as optional gear), Coach (suggests specific tooth-injury first aid)

**Fix:** Add brief dental first aid: "If a permanent tooth gets knocked out, hold it by the crown (not the root), rinse gently with milk or saliva, and get to a dentist within 30 minutes." Consider also adding mouth guards as optional gear in Ch 2.

**Files:** `content/33-appendix-first-aid-headfractures.md` or `content/32-appendix-first-aid-scrapessprains.md`, `content/07-ch-2-safety-gear-knees-shoes.md`

---

### 30. Comma splice on page 29

**Issue:** "But do go during off-peak hours at first, early mornings and weekdays are usually quieter" is a comma splice.

**Flagged by:** Editor-in-Chief

**Fix:** Split into two sentences: "But do go during off-peak hours at first. Early mornings and weekdays are usually quieter."

**File:** `content/27-ch-8-skatepark-etiquette-rules-4-6.md`

---

## Tier 4: Nice-to-Have / Consider

- **Practice plan pacing:** The bullet-point format in Ch 6 reads more like a handout than a book. Inject brief narrative beats between weekly sections to maintain the book's voice. (Children's Author)
- **"Here's the thing" repetition:** Appears at the start of paragraphs in several chapters. Vary three of the four instances, keep the one in Chapter 7. (Children's Author)
- **Chapter 2 poem is the weakest of five:** Consider expanding by one couplet to give it more emotional weight as the book's first poem. (Children's Author)
- **Chapter 9 poem "dime" rhyme:** "That joy is worth every dime" introduces a monetary metaphor into a purely emotional moment. Consider a different rhyme. (Children's Author)
- **"Dropping in" on page 25 needs parenthetical definition:** A child who has not been to a park will not know what this means. (Teacher)
- **"Regular" and "switch" relationship:** Make more explicit that riding switch means riding in your non-dominant stance. (Teacher)
- **Four-way stop analogy in skatepark chapter:** Many 8-10 year olds may not understand four-way stop etiquette. Consider a school hallway or playground analogy. (Teacher)
- **Readiness checklist before Week 5-8:** "Before starting Week 5, you should be able to: ride 5 minutes straight, stop confidently using two methods, turn in both directions." (Teacher, Coach)
- **Readiness checklist before the ollie:** "Make sure you can do a solid kickturn and a one-second manual." (Coach)
- **Tic-tacs earlier as a warm-up drill:** Mention in Week 1-2 as a warm-up activity, not just Week 5-8 as a technique. (Skateboarder, Coach)
- **Stationary tick-tock drill on grass:** Great intro to tail pressure for Ch 3. (Coach)
- **Cone weave and stop box drills:** Fun, concrete practice games for Week 3-4. (Coach)
- **How to carry your board:** Standard carry (tucked under arm, grip tape away from body). Sounds trivial, is not. (Skateboarder)
- **Board maintenance basics:** Grip tape cleaning, bearing wipe-down, don't leave board in rain or hot car. Half-page in Ch 1 or appendix. (Skateboarder, Editor-in-Chief)
- **Where to go after this book (ollie resources):** The "another book" tease could leave motivated kids feeling abandoned. Add a suggestion: ask at a local skate shop, or name follow-up resources. (Teacher)
- **Parent skating alongside child:** Brief note about the bonding value of struggling together. (Psychologist)
- **Cross-reference from Ch 5 to Ch 7 emotional content:** "If this feels impossible right now, it isn't. Turn to Chapter 7 whenever you need it." (Teacher)
- **Forward reference from practice plan to Ch 4 falling exercises:** "See page 15 for the exercises." (Teacher)
- **No parent note in the first aid appendix:** A note about staying calm and assessing before reacting during a child's injury. (Teacher)
- **Week 5-8 expectations too optimistic for manuals/switch riding:** Reframe from "start exploring" to "start trying, some will click quickly, some will take months." (Coach)
- **"Nose" and "tail" could be bolded or called out on first use:** They get buried in the deck paragraph. (Editor-in-Chief)
- **Opening note "parents, guardians, cool aunts, nervous grandparents":** Consider adding "older siblings," "uncles," "coaches." (Teacher, Editor-in-Chief)
- **Chapter 6 title lacks personality:** "The Practice Plan: What to Do and When to Do It" is functional but flat compared to other chapter titles. (Editor-in-Chief)
- **Chapter 9 title calls itself "very brief":** Undermines its own importance. (Editor-in-Chief)
- **Appendix transition from Ch 10:** Add a sentence in the book's voice before clinical content begins. (Children's Author)
- **Character growth illustration beat:** Add one note showing a supporting critter achieving something they struggled with earlier. (Children's Author)
- **Illustration note prioritization:** Mark which visual elements are essential vs. nice-to-have for the illustrator. (Children's Author)
- **Wax etiquette at skateparks:** Don't wax ledges without checking if it's okay. Minor for a beginner book. (Skateboarder)
- **Hot surfaces warning in appendix:** "If it is too hot to touch, it is too hot to fall on." (Coach)
- **Grabbing onto someone when falling:** Mention not to grab a nearby person, it takes both people down. (Coach)
- **Board slope test:** "Set your board down and see if it rolls on its own." (Coach)
- **Speed and turning:** "Turns are easier with a little speed. Give yourself two or three pushes before trying to turn." (Coach)
- **About the Author section and back matter:** Needed for publication. (Editor-in-Chief)
- **Factual claims to verify:** 1950s skateboarding origins, Tony Hawk/Andy Anderson named endorsements (living people risk), ASTM F1492 currency, Gelfand "poorly built pool" detail, PEACE & LOVE protocol completeness. (Editor-in-Chief)
- **Named pro skater risk:** Tony Hawk and Andy Anderson are living people whose practices or reputations could change. Consider whether "the best professionals in the world" is safer long-term. (Editor-in-Chief)
- **Helmet shake joke:** Could a child actually shake their head too hard testing a helmet? Small risk. (Editor-in-Chief)
- **Bug-flattening simile in stopping:** "Like you're trying to flatten a very persistent bug." Some children's editors might flag this. (Editor-in-Chief)

## Consensus Praise

Every reviewer, without exception, praised the following:

**The falling chapter (Ch 4) and its placement before the first ride.** All six reviewers called out the decision to teach falling as a prerequisite skill rather than an afterthought. The Skateboarder called it "outstanding." The Coach said it matches exactly how they teach. The Teacher called it "particularly smart." The Psychologist noted it primes the reader to understand that if falling can be learned, coping can be learned too.

**The fear and resilience content (Ch 7).** Every reviewer highlighted this as the emotional core of the book. The passage "Fear is not weakness. Ignoring fear is not bravery" was cited by the Skateboarder, Psychologist, Coach, and Children's Author. The Psychologist called it "an accurate and sophisticated model of courage that many adults have not internalized." The Coach said it is "exactly the messages I try to instill in my students."

**"Comparison is a thief. Progress is personal."** Cited by the Psychologist, Teacher, Children's Author, and Coach. The Teacher called it "the emotional thesis of the book." The Psychologist connected it to Erikson's industry vs. inferiority stage.

**The parent note: "Don't say 'You're fine.' Don't say 'Get back on.'"** Cited by the Psychologist, Teacher, Coach, and Children's Author. The Coach said "this is advice I give parents at every single clinic and camp." The Psychologist called it "the gold standard for emotional coaching."

**The voice and tone.** Every reviewer praised the consistency, humor, and respect for the reader. The Children's Author: "It reads like a smart, kind adult talking directly to a kid who they actually respect, which is shockingly rare." The Skateboarder: "It reads like someone who actually skates talking to someone who doesn't yet." The Editor-in-Chief: "The author has solved one of the hardest problems in children's nonfiction."

**The dedication.** The Psychologist called it "psychologically sound." The Children's Author called it "quietly brilliant." The Editor-in-Chief said "do not change this."

**The safety gear content, especially helmet standards.** The Skateboarder was "genuinely impressed" by the ASTM F1492 callout. The Coach called it "one of the best I have seen in a children's book." The Teacher praised the concrete measurement ("two finger-widths above eyebrows") as a model of physical instruction for children.

**The dual-audience approach (kids and parents together).** All six reviewers noted this as a market differentiator and a strength. The Teacher called the parent notes "consistently excellent." The Editor-in-Chief identified this as the book's strongest market differentiator.

**The closing line: "However wobbly, you belong."** The Children's Author: "the kind of sentence that defines a book." The Editor-in-Chief flagged it as memorable and market-defining. The Teacher called it "the pedagogical philosophy of the entire book."

## Conflicts (Author Decisions Documented)

### Stopping method order
- **Skateboarder** lists the three methods as foot brake, step-off, tail scrape (matching the book's current order) without suggesting a reorder.
- **Coach** strongly recommends reordering to step-off first, foot brake second, because the foot brake requires single-leg balance that very young beginners cannot reliably do for weeks.
- **AUTHOR DECISION:** Step-off (run-off) first, foot brake second, tail scrape third. The run-off is the easiest and most natural first stop. The foot brake requires single-leg balance on a moving board, which is harder than it sounds for young kids. The whole stopping section needs a rethink, see notes below.

**Stopping section rework notes:** The current three methods actually represent three tiers of difficulty:
1. **Run-off / step-off** (easiest, day one): Step forward off the board, keep walking/jogging in the direction you were going. Both feet on ground, natural motion. Current text says "step off the front" which is almost right but needs to be clearer: you're stepping forward and jogging out, not jumping off the nose. The board just rolls away behind you.
2. **Foot brake** (medium, requires balance): Take back foot off, drag sole on ground. Requires balancing on one leg on a moving board while controlling drag pressure. Most useful stop long-term, but not the easiest to learn.
3. **Tail scrape** (hardest, already-know-what-you're-doing move): Weight transfer to back foot, press tail. Wears the tail. Really a "later" skill.

The descriptions, order, and illustration note all need updating to reflect this progression. The step-off description specifically needs to make clear you step forward and jog it out (never backward, never jump off the nose).

### Chapter 9 handling
- **Children's Author** strongly recommends moving Ch 9 to a preface or second appendix to avoid breaking the child reader's flow between Ch 8 and Ch 10.
- **Editor-in-Chief** suggests either expanding Ch 9 and trimming inline parent notes, OR cutting Ch 9 and redistributing its content. Does not specifically recommend moving it.
- **AUTHOR DECISION:** Parent content moves to an epilogue, placed AFTER the finale ("However wobbly, you belong") and BEFORE the appendix. Not a preface, not a chapter. An epilogue. The parent prose (support page) and the parent poem each get their own page. Rationale: after reading the whole book with their kid, the parent hits "Look at their face. LOOK at their face." and it lands harder than it ever could as a preface. The inline parent notes throughout the book stay as-is, they work fine as standalone reminders without needing a briefing up front. Final book order: Cover, Dedication, Note Before We Begin, Ch 1-8 (uninterrupted), The End (prose + poem finale), Parent Epilogue (prose), Parent Epilogue (poem, own page), Appendix: First Aid (urgent), Appendix: First Aid (everyday), Appendix: Practice Plan.

### Page 5 (parts) density
- **Teacher** says this is the densest page in the book and suggests splitting it into two pages or using a labeled diagram to carry some weight.
- **Editor-in-Chief** mentions board sizing should be added here, which would increase density further.
- **No other reviewer flagged density as a problem.** The Skateboarder reviewed every part description and found them accurate and appropriately detailed.
- **AUTHOR DECISION:** Board sizing does NOT go on the parts page. Board sizing content deferred to `content/notes/nose-tail-cut.md` alongside other potential additional pages. Parts page stays as-is for now, may split later if layout demands it.

### Practice plan voice (Ch 6)
- **Children's Author** says the practice plan chapter loses the book's voice and becomes a checklist, suggesting narrative beats between weeks.
- **Teacher** praises the bullet-point format as "easy to scan and revisit, which is exactly how a practice plan should work."
- **AUTHOR DECISION:** Ch 6 (Practice Plan) moves out of the chapter sequence and becomes an appendix section, placed AFTER the first aid appendix pages. Order: (1) Appendix: First Aid (urgent), (2) Appendix: First Aid (everyday), (3) Appendix: Practice Plan. Rationale: first aid is crisis reference (flip to it when someone is hurt), practice plan is casual reference (check it between sessions). This also removes the pacing problem, the book's chapter flow goes straight from Ch 7 (Hard Parts) to Ch 8 (Skatepark Etiquette) to the finale without a checklist interrupting the emotional build. The practice plan content itself may still benefit from illustration/whimsy treatment in layout, but that's a design decision, not a content one.

### Step-off direction
- **Skateboarder** says the book describes stepping off "the front" and recommends changing to "to the side" or "back foot first."
- **Coach** says stepping off forward (run-off) is the most natural beginner stop but separately warns against stepping off backward.
- **AUTHOR DECISION:** The run-off (step forward, jog it out) is the primary method. Covered in the stopping section rework above. "Step off to the side" is fine as a secondary note. Key safety line: never step off backward.

### Whether to name specific pro skaters (Hawk, Anderson)
- **Editor-in-Chief** notes these are living people whose practices could change or who could become controversial, and suggests a more general "the best professionals" framing may be safer long-term.
- **Skateboarder** did not flag this as a concern and validated the cultural authenticity of the references.
- **AUTHOR DECISION:** Keep the names. They're compelling for kids and culturally authentic. No edits.
