# Skateboarder's Technical Review

**Reviewer background:** 20+ years skating, amateur competitive experience, taught dozens of kids from first push through their first kickflips. Reviewing for technical accuracy, safety, progression, and cultural authenticity.

**Overall impression:** This is an excellent beginner skateboarding book. The technical information is solid, the progression is well structured, and the safety content is genuinely better than what I see in most instructional material, including stuff aimed at adults. The tone is perfect for the audience. I have specific notes below, but I want to be clear up front: this book gets the important stuff right, and the important stuff is what keeps kids safe and skating.

## Technical Accuracy: Skateboard Parts (Chapter 1, Pages 4-5)

### Deck Description
The description of the deck as "7-ply maple" is accurate and standard. Good.

### Trucks
The truck description is correct and the beginner advice to keep them tighter is solid. One small addition worth considering: the text says "Loose trucks = easier turning, more wobble. Tight trucks = harder turning, more stability." This is true, but it might help to mention that trucks should never be cranked so tight they don't turn at all. I've seen parents tighten their kid's trucks until the board rides like a train on rails, which is actually more dangerous because the kid can't steer around obstacles. A note like "tighter, but still able to turn when you lean" would help.

### Wheels
"Bigger, softer wheels = smoother ride over rough ground. Smaller, harder wheels = better for tricks. For learning, go bigger and softer." This is correct and good advice. No issues.

### Bearings
"Keep them dry" is the right primary message for beginners. No issues.

### Hardware
"There are eight of them." This is correct (eight bolts, four per truck). Good detail that most books skip.

### Price Range for Parent Note
The parent note says "$80-$140" for a complete from a real skate shop. This was accurate a couple years ago but in 2025/2026, a shop complete is more realistically $90-$160 depending on region. The low end might still exist but it's getting harder to find. Consider bumping the range slightly, or saying "around $100-$150" which gives a safer middle ground. Not a dealbreaker, but parents will trust the book more if the number matches what they actually find at the shop.

## Technical Accuracy: Safety Gear (Chapter 2, Pages 6-9)

### Helmet Standards
The ASTM F1492 callout is exactly right and I'm genuinely impressed it's here. Most beginner books just say "wear a helmet" without specifying the skate-specific standard. The dual-certification recommendation (ASTM F1492 + CPSC) is also correct. The fit description, two finger-widths above eyebrows, snug, no wobble, is textbook.

### Multi-Impact vs. Single-Impact
The explanation that skate helmets handle multiple impacts while bike helmets are designed for a single hit is accurate and important. This distinction saves kids from wearing the wrong helmet. Well done.

### Helmet Replacement
"Replace your helmet after any significant impact" is correct. The "one-hit wonder" line is funny and accurate for the foam compression explanation.

### Wrist Guards
The biomechanics explanation (rigid splint distributing force across the forearm) is accurate. "Wrist fractures are the most common skateboarding injury" is correct per the research. This section is strong.

### Knee Pads and the Knee Slide
Describing knee pads as a "falling tool" rather than just protection is excellent and shows real skating knowledge. The knee slide explanation is accurate and this is genuinely one of the most important skills for transition skating. The instruction to practice it on smooth surfaces is correct.

### Skate Shoes
The flat-sole recommendation and the specific brand mentions (Vans, Etnies, Nike SB) are all appropriate and current. The warning against running shoes, sandals, and boots is correct.

### One Possible Addition
The book doesn't mention mouth guards. For younger kids (especially those still with baby teeth or new adult teeth coming in), a mouth guard is worth mentioning as optional but smart. Dental injuries from skateboarding are more common than people think, and a $2 boil-and-bite guard from a drugstore can save thousands in dental work. This could fit as a brief parenthetical after the elbow pads section.

## Technical Accuracy: Stance and Board Familiarity (Chapter 3, Pages 10-12)

### Stance Tests
All three tests (slide test, push test, stair test) are legitimate methods used in real instruction. The slide test is the most common one I use when teaching. The push test (someone pushing you from behind) is also widely used. The stair test is less common but still valid. No issues.

### "If all three tests give you different answers"
This is a real thing that happens and I'm glad it's addressed. Telling kids to just go with what feels comfortable is the right call.

### Grass/Carpet Practice
Starting on grass or carpet is standard beginner instruction and the reasoning (board won't roll) is correct. The four steps (stand, bend knees, shift weight, get on/off) are a solid progression.

### Foot Placement
"Front foot near the front bolts" and "back foot near the back bolts" is correct beginner foot placement. The bolts are the standard reference point for foot positioning. Good.

### Weight and Balance
"Keep your shoulders over your feet" is correct. The emphasis on low center of gravity is correct. "Imagine you are a very relaxed, slightly crouching person who is totally in control" is actually a pretty good way to describe the ideal beginner stance.

---

## Technical Accuracy: Pushing, Stopping, and Turning (Chapter 5, Pages 17-19)

### Pushing Mechanics
The pushing description is accurate: front foot angled forward toward the nose, back foot pushes, then rotate front foot sideways and place back foot on tail. This is the correct sequence.

### Mongo Pushing
The mongo pushing note is handled well. "While it works, it makes everything else harder later" is accurate and diplomatic. Mongo puts you in a less stable position and makes it harder to set up for tricks. The book correctly identifies it as a common mistake without being preachy about it.

### Stopping Methods
All three methods (foot brake, step-off, tail scrape) are legitimate beginner stopping techniques and they're described correctly.

**One concern with the step-off description:** The text says "step off the front of the board." For a beginner, stepping off the front while the board is moving can be tricky because the board can shoot backward and hit someone behind you, or your foot can catch. It might be clearer to say "step off to the side" or "step off with your back foot first, then your front foot." Stepping off the front works at very low speeds, but the way it's described could lead to the board squirting out behind the kid.

### Tail Scrape
The note about tail scrapes wearing down the tail is accurate and a good reason to favor the foot brake. Correct.

### Turning
"Lean your toes and the board curves one way. Lean your heels and it curves the other" is correct for carving/lean turns. The advice to start with big, wide turns is appropriate for beginners.

### Missing: Which Direction Is Which
The turning section doesn't specify which way the board turns when you lean on your toes vs. heels. For a regular footer, toe-side lean turns the board to the right (if facing forward). For a goofy footer, it's the opposite. A beginner might benefit from a brief note that the direction depends on your stance, or even just "lean toward your toes and the board turns toward where your toes point." This isn't wrong as written, it just might leave a kid confused about which way they'll actually go when they lean.

## Technical Accuracy: Falling (Chapter 4, Pages 13-16)

This chapter is outstanding. I want to say that clearly. Teaching kids to fall before teaching them to ride is the single most important thing a skateboarding book can do, and most don't. The fact that this is emphasized as "the most important chapter in this book" is correct.

### Rule 1: Never Catch Yourself with Straight Arms
Accurate. This is the number one injury prevention tip in skateboarding.

### Rule 2: Tuck and Roll
Accurate. "Be a ball, not a stick" is a great way to explain it to kids.

### Rule 3: Spread the Impact
Accurate. Landing on fleshy parts (thighs, butt, shoulders) rather than bony parts is correct.

### Rule 4: The Knee Slide
Already covered above, this is accurate and important.

### Rule 5: Running It Out
"Sometimes, especially at low speeds, you can just step off." This is correct and I appreciate that it's framed as legitimate rather than cowardly. "There is no shame in stepping off" is an important message.

### Falling Practice Drills
The four drills (side fall, tuck and roll, knee slide, running off) are all standard falling practice exercises. The repetition counts are reasonable. The note that every professional skateboarder has done this is true.

### One Minor Addition
Rule 2 mentions tucking your chin, which is critical and correct. But it might be worth emphasizing this more, maybe bolding "tuck your chin" or giving it its own callout. A chin tuck is the difference between hitting the back of your head on the ground and not. In my experience teaching, this is the single hardest instinct to train into someone, and the more the book emphasizes it, the better.

## Practice Plan and Progression (Chapter 6, Pages 20-22)

### Progression Order
The overall progression is excellent:

1. Parts and gear knowledge
2. Stance finding
3. Static board familiarity (grass/carpet)
4. Falling practice
5. Pushing and riding straight
6. Stopping
7. Turning
8. Practice plan with weekly structure
9. Advanced basics (kickturns, switch, manuals, tic-tacs)
10. Ollie introduction

This is a sound instructional progression. It matches how I teach kids in real life, with one exception noted below.

### Week 1-2 Goals
"Push and ride 50 feet without stepping off" is a reasonable week 1-2 goal. "Stop on purpose within a few feet of where you intend" is also reasonable. "Make S-turns without feeling like you're about to die" is funny and realistic.

### Week 3-4 Goals
"Riding over small cracks and bumps (weight forward, knees bent)" is correct technique for obstacles. The advice to shift weight forward over cracks is right. However, the text says "weight forward" but doesn't specify that this means leaning slightly toward the nose/front of the board, not leaning your whole body forward (which would pitch you over the handlebars, so to speak). A small clarification like "shift your weight slightly toward your front foot" would be more precise.

### Week 5-8 Skills
Kickturns, switch riding, manuals, and tic-tacs are all appropriate next steps. The parenthetical about switch riding ("this will feel like starting over") is accurate and important to set expectations.

### Week 9+ / Ollie
The ollie history is accurate. Alan "Ollie" Gelfand did invent it in the late 1970s skating pools in Florida. Rodney Mullen did adapt it to flatground. "Learning to ollie will take you weeks of practice" is honest and correct, possibly even optimistic for some kids, but the right message.

### Missing From the Progression: Tick-Tock Warm-Up
Tic-tacs are mentioned in weeks 5-8, but they're actually a great warm-up drill from day one on flat ground. Quick little left-right pivots on the back wheels help beginners get comfortable with weight shifting and the feeling of the tail. Consider mentioning them earlier as a warm-up activity, even in the week 1-2 section, then revisiting them as a speed-building technique in weeks 5-8.

### Missing Fundamental: Pushing with Comfortable Glide
The practice plan jumps from "pushing and riding in a straight line" to stopping and turning, but doesn't explicitly call out the skill of pushing multiple times and gliding comfortably. A lot of beginners push once and immediately try to stop. The skill of push, push, push, glide, push, push, push, glide is fundamental and worth its own bullet point. Something like "Practice pushing 3-4 times in a row and then gliding in a balanced stance."

## Skatepark Etiquette (Chapter 8, Pages 27-29)

### Rules Accuracy
All six rules are legitimate, widely recognized skatepark etiquette. Snaking, sitting on obstacles, stopping in flow areas, these are the real unwritten rules, and the book describes them correctly.

### "Like a four-way stop"
This is actually a great analogy for explaining skatepark flow to kids. The take-turns concept is accurate.

### Beginner Timing
"Go during off-peak hours at first, early mornings and weekdays" is correct and practical advice.

### "Encourage Others"
The culture of hyping each other up is real and accurately described. The nod, the "nice!" call, this is authentic.

### Parent Note About Older Skaters
"If an older skater gives your kid a tip, that's not a stranger being weird, that's skateboard culture" is accurate and important. Knowledge transfer at the park is a real and valuable part of skate culture. Good that it's addressed directly for parents who might be uneasy.

### One Missing Etiquette Point
The book doesn't mention headphones/earbuds at the skatepark. This is increasingly relevant with kids. Skating with earbuds in means you can't hear someone calling "dropping!" or approaching from behind. It's a safety and etiquette issue. Even a brief note like "Keep your ears open at the park, save the headphones for solo cruising" would be valuable.

### Another Missing Point: Wax and Modifications
Kids should know not to wax ledges or rails at a public park without checking if it's okay. Wax changes the surface for everyone. This is minor for a beginner book, but since you have a whole etiquette chapter, it might be worth a sentence.

## First Aid Appendix (Pages 34-35)

### Head Injury Protocol
"If you hit your head, you are done skating for the day. No exceptions." This is correct and unambiguous. The concussion symptom list is accurate. Good.

### PEACE & LOVE vs. RICE
The book correctly notes that RICE is outdated and references the PEACE & LOVE protocol. This is current sports medicine guidance. Impressive that this made it into a children's book.

### Wrist Fracture Advice
"Wrist fractures are sneaky. They sometimes feel like a bad sprain." This is accurate and important. The advice to get an X-ray when in doubt is correct.

### Road Rash Treatment
Clean with soap and water, antibiotic ointment, bandage, change daily. All correct.

### Heat Safety
The heat section is good. The warning about skin getting hot and stopping sweating (a sign of heat stroke, not just heat exhaustion) is an important detail that's correctly included.

### One Concern: Anti-Inflammatory Advice
The PEACE & LOVE section says "Avoid anti-inflammatories for the first day or two." This is current evidence-based guidance, but in a children's book, it might cause confusion for parents who instinctively reach for ibuprofen. Consider adding a brief parenthetical like "(this means ibuprofen and similar medicines, check with your doctor)" so parents know exactly what's meant and that a doctor's guidance supersedes a skateboarding book.

## Missing Fundamentals

These are things the book doesn't cover that I think a beginner really benefits from knowing.

### 1. How to Carry Your Board
This sounds trivial but it's not. Kids carry boards by the trucks and bash themselves in the shins, or they hold them by the nose/tail and the grip tape shreds their clothes. The standard carry (board tucked under your arm, grip tape facing away from your body, hand gripping the truck or between the trucks) is worth a brief mention somewhere, maybe in Chapter 1 alongside the parts.

### 2. Checking Your Board Before Riding
A quick pre-ride check: spin your wheels (are they all spinning freely?), wiggle your trucks (are they still attached solidly?), check your hardware (any loose bolts?). This takes ten seconds and prevents the "my wheel fell off while I was riding" scenario that happens more than you'd think with kids' boards. This could fit in Chapter 3 before the first ride.

### 3. Surface Awareness
The book mentions finding smooth surfaces and avoiding cracks, which is good. But it doesn't explicitly warn about wet surfaces (slippery), sand/gravel on smooth surfaces (wheels lock up), or painted surfaces like crosswalk lines (slippery when wet or even damp). Wet metal, like drain grates or manhole covers, is especially dangerous. A brief "surfaces to watch out for" note would help, possibly in Chapter 5 where the first ride happens.

### 4. What to Do When You Hit a Pebble
Every beginner's nightmare: you're rolling along and a pebble stops your front wheel dead. You fly forward. The book mentions riding over cracks in weeks 3-4, but the pebble stop is a specific and very common scenario. The solution (weight slightly back, knees bent, ride loose so you can absorb) is worth mentioning. This is closely related to the "weight forward over cracks" advice, but the pebble scenario is different because the fix is actually to NOT have too much weight forward.

### 5. Board Maintenance Basics
Just a sentence or two: grip tape can be cleaned with a rubber grip gum eraser. Bearings can be wiped down if they get dusty. Don't leave your board in the rain or in a hot car. This could be a small sidebar in Chapter 1 or in the appendix.

## Cultural and Language Notes

### Tone and Voice
The voice is authentic. It reads like someone who actually skates talking to someone who doesn't yet. The humor doesn't undermine the instruction. The respect for the reader (not talking down to kids) is important and well executed.

### "Skateboarder" Identity
The line "the fact that you're reading this book, that you're trying, that you fell down and you're thinking about getting back up? That means you're already a skateboarder" (Chapter 7, page 24) is culturally accurate and meaningful. In real skate culture, the identity is about participation and persistence, not skill level. This is exactly right.

### Mongo Pushing
Handled well. The book flags it as a common mistake without being judgmental. In some skate circles, mongo pushing gets mocked, but the book correctly frames it as a practical issue (makes things harder later) rather than a cultural one (looks uncool). Right choice for a kids' book.

### The Fear Section
The section on fear (Chapter 7, page 25) is one of the best treatments of this topic I've seen in any skateboarding resource. "Fear is not weakness. Ignoring fear is not bravery." This is genuinely important for kids to hear, and it's culturally aligned with how the best coaches and mentors in skating actually talk about fear.

### Parent/Guardian Inclusion
The consistent parent notes throughout the book are a smart structural choice. The advice is practical and emotionally intelligent. "Don't say 'You're fine' (they might not be). Don't say 'Get back on' (they'll decide when)." This is exactly the kind of guidance parents need.

## Summary of Suggested Changes (Priority Order)

1. **Step-off stopping technique (Ch 5, p. 18):** Clarify that you step off to the side or back foot first, not "off the front of the board," to prevent the board shooting backward.
2. **Chin tuck emphasis (Ch 4, p. 13):** Consider bolding or further emphasizing "tuck your chin" in Rule 2. This is the most critical falling detail.
3. **Truck tightness clarification (Ch 1, p. 5):** Add a note that trucks should still be able to turn even when tightened for beginners.
4. **Weight distribution over cracks (Ch 6, p. 21):** Clarify "weight forward" means slightly toward the front foot, not leaning the whole body forward.
5. **Turning direction clarification (Ch 5, p. 19):** Brief note on which way the board actually goes when you lean on toes vs. heels.
6. **Surface hazards (Ch 5, p. 17):** Add wet surfaces, sand/gravel, painted lines, and metal grates to the list of things to avoid.
7. **Pre-ride board check (Ch 3, p. 11):** Quick wheel-spin, truck-wiggle, hardware check before riding.
8. **Headphones at the park (Ch 8, p. 28-29):** Brief note about keeping ears open for safety and awareness.
9. **Price range update (Ch 1, p. 4):** Consider updating the $80-$140 range to reflect current pricing.
10. **Anti-inflammatory clarification (Appendix, p. 35):** Parenthetical explaining what "anti-inflammatories" means in plain language.

Items 1-3 are the ones I'd call important for safety. Items 4-10 are improvements that would make the book stronger but aren't urgent.

## Final Verdict

This book is ready for publication with minor revisions. The technical content is accurate, the safety information is better than average, the progression is sound, and the cultural representation is authentic. The emotional content around fear, failure, and persistence is genuinely excellent and reflects a mature understanding of what it actually takes to learn to skateboard. Most importantly, this book respects kids enough to give them real information instead of watered-down nonsense, and that's exactly what a good skateboarding book should do.

I'd let my students' parents buy this book without hesitation.
