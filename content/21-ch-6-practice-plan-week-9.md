**WEEK 9+: THE TRICK DOOR**

If you've done all the above, you are ready to start learning your first real trick: **the ollie.**

The ollie is skateboarding's foundational trick. It's how you jump with the board. Its inventor, Alan "Ollie" Gelfand, actually stumbled onto it by accident in the late 1970s while skating a poorly built pool in Florida—and it took the skateboarding world years to fully understand and adapt it. Rodney Mullen later figured out how to do it on flat ground. Learning to ollie will take you weeks of practice. This is normal.

But that's another chapter for another day. (Or another book. One that will definitely contain diagrams and probably more jokes about gravity.)

> A note for parents: Progress is not linear. Some days they'll look amazing. Some days they'll look like they've never seen a skateboard before. Both are normal. Both are part of the process. Keep showing up.
